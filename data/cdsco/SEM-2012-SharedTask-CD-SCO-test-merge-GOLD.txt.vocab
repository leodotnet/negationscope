1.
the
singular
experience
of
mr.
john
scott
eccles
i
find
it
recorded
in
my
notebook
that
it
was
a
bleak
and
windy
day
towards
the
end
of
march
in
the
year
1892
.
holmes
had
received
a
telegram
while
we
sat
at
our
lunch
,
and
he
had
scribbled
a
reply
.
he
made
no
remark
,
but
the
matter
remained
in
his
thoughts
,
for
he
stood
in
front
of
the
fire
afterwards
with
a
thoughtful
face
,
smoking
his
pipe
,
and
casting
an
occasional
glance
at
the
message
.
suddenly
he
turned
upon
me
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
his
eyes
.
``
i
suppose
,
watson
,
we
must
look
upon
you
as
a
man
of
letters
,
''
said
he
.
``
how
do
you
define
the
word
`
grotesque
'
?
''
``
strange
--
remarkable
,
''
i
suggested
.
he
shook
his
head
at
my
definition
.
``
there
is
surely
something
more
than
that
,
''
said
he
;
``
some
underlying
suggestion
of
the
tragic
and
the
terrible
.
if
you
cast
your
mind
back
to
some
of
those
narratives
with
which
you
have
afflicted
a
long-suffering
public
,
you
will
recognize
how
often
the
grotesque
has
deepened
into
the
criminal
.
think
of
that
little
affair
of
the
red-headed
men
.
that
was
grotesque
enough
in
the
outset
,
and
yet
it
ended
in
a
desperate
attempt
at
robbery
.
or
,
again
,
there
was
that
most
grotesque
affair
of
the
five
orange
pips
,
which
led
straight
to
a
murderous
conspiracy
.
the
word
puts
me
on
the
alert
.
''
``
have
you
it
there
?
''
i
asked
.
he
read
the
telegram
aloud
.
``
have
just
had
most
incredible
and
grotesque
experience
.
may
i
consult
you
?
``

``

''
``
man
or
woman
?
''
i
asked
.
``
oh
,
man
,
of
course
.
no
woman
would
ever
send
a
reply-paid
telegram
.
she
would
have
come
.
''
``
will
you
see
him
?
''
``
my
dear
watson
,
you
know
how
bored
i
have
been
since
we
locked
up
colonel
carruthers
.
my
mind
is
like
a
racing
engine
,
tearing
itself
to
pieces
because
it
is
not
connected
up
with
the
work
for
which
it
was
built
.
life
is
commonplace
,
the
papers
are
sterile
;
audacity
and
romance
seem
to
have
passed
forever
from
the
criminal
world
.
can
you
ask
me
,
then
,
whether
i
am
ready
to
look
into
any
new
problem
,
however
trivial
it
may
prove
?
but
here
,
unless
i
am
mistaken
,
is
our
client
.
''
a
measured
step
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
,
and
a
moment
later
a
stout
,
tall
,
gray-whiskered
and
solemnly
respectable
person
was
ushered
into
the
room
.
his
life
history
was
written
in
his
heavy
features
and
pompous
manner
.
from
his
spats
to
his
gold-rimmed
spectacles
he
was
a
conservative
,
a
churchman
,
a
good
citizen
,
orthodox
and
conventional
to
the
last
degree
.
but
some
amazing
experience
had
disturbed
his
native
composure
and
left
its
traces
in
his
bristling
hair
,
his
flushed
,
angry
cheeks
,
and
his
flurried
,
excited
manner
.
he
plunged
instantly
into
his
business
.
``
i
have
had
a
most
singular
and
unpleasant
experience
,
mr.
holmes
,
''
said
he
.
``
never
in
my
life
have
i
been
placed
in
such
a
situation
.
it
is
most
improper
--
most
outrageous
.
i
must
insist
upon
some
explanation
.
''
he
swelled
and
puffed
in
his
anger
.
``
pray
sit
down
,
mr.
scott
eccles
,
''
said
holmes
in
a
soothing
voice
.
``
may
i
ask
,
in
the
first
place
,
why
you
came
to
me
at
all
?

``
well
,
sir
,
it
did
not
appear
to
be
a
matter
which
concerned
the
police

facts

you
must

holmes
glanced
at
his
watch
.

is
a
quarter-past
two
,

he
said
.
``

``
you
are
right
,
mr.
holmes

i
never
gave
a
thought
to
my
toilet

i
was
only
too
glad
to
get
out
of
such
a
house
.
but
i
have
been
running
round
making
inquiries
before
i
came
to
you

i
went
to
the
house

they
said
that

was
paid
up

right

was
in
order
at

''
``

said
holmes
,
laughing
.
``

our

looked
down
with
a
rueful
face
at
his
own
unconventional
appearance

i
'm
sure
it
must
look
very
bad
,
mr.
holmes
,

i
am
not
aware

in
my
whole
life
such
a
thing
has
ever
happened
before

i
will
tell
you
the
whole
queer
business
,

when

done
so
you
will
admit

i
am
sure
,
that
there
has
been
enough
to
excuse
me
.
''
but
his
narrative
was
nipped
in
the
bud
.
there
was
a
bustle
outside
,
and
mrs.
hudson
opened
the
door
to
usher
in
two
robust
and
official-looking
individuals
,
one
of
whom
was
well
known
to
us
as
inspector
gregson
of
scotland
yard
,
an
energetic
,
gallant
,
and
,
within
his
limitations
,
a
capable
officer
.
he
shook
hands
with
holmes
and
introduced
his
comrade
as
inspector
baynes
,
of
the
surrey
constabulary
.
``
we
are
hunting
together
,
mr.
holmes
,
and
our
trail
lay
in
this
direction
.

he
turned
his
bulldog
eyes
upon
our
visitor

you

all
the

holmes

we
picked
up
the

night
of

near
esher
.
''
our
client
had
sat
up
with
staring
eyes
and
every
tinge
of
colour
struck
from
his
astonished
face
.
``
dead
?
did
you
say
he
was
dead
?
''
``
yes

no

''
our
visitor
had
gulped
off
the
brandy
and
the
colour
had
returned
to
his
face
.
with
a
dubious
glance
at
the
inspector
's
notebook
,
he
plunged
at
once
into
his
extraordinary
statement
.
``
i
am
a
bachelor
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
being
of
a
sociable
turn
i
cultivate
a
large
number
of
friends
.
among
these
are
the
family
of
a
retired
brewer
called
melville
,
living
at
abermarle
mansion
,
kensington
.
it
was
at
his
table
that
i
met
some
weeks
ago
a
young
fellow
named
garcia
.
he
was
,
i
understood
,
of
spanish
descent
and
connected
in
some
way
with
the
embassy
.
he
spoke
perfect
english
,
was
pleasing
in
his
manners
,
and
as
good-looking
a
man
as
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
.
``
in
some
way
we
struck
up
quite
a
friendship
,
this
young
fellow
and
i
.
he
seemed
to
take
a
fancy
to
me
from
the
first
,
and
within
two
days
of
our
meeting
he
came
to
see
me
at
lee
.
one
thing
led
to
another
,
and
it
ended
in
his
inviting
me
out
to
spend
a
few
days
at
his
house
,
wisteria
lodge
,
between
esher
and
oxshott
.
yesterday
evening
i
went
to
esher
to
fulfil
this
engagement
.
``
he
had
described
his
household
to
me
before
i
went
there
.
he
lived
with
a
faithful
servant
,
a
countryman
of
his
own
,
who
looked
after
all
his
needs
.
this
fellow
could
speak
english
and
did
his
housekeeping
for
him
.
then
there
was
a
wonderful
cook
,
he
said
,
a
half-breed
whom
he
had
picked
up
in
his
travels
,
who
could
serve
an
excellent
dinner
.
i
remember
that
he
remarked
what
a
queer
household
it
was
to
find
in
the
heart
of
surrey
,
and
that
i
agreed
with
him
,
though
it
has
proved
a
good
deal
queerer
than
i
thought
.
``
i
drove
to
the
place
--
about
two
miles
on
the
south
side
of
esher
.
the
house
was
a
fair-sized
one
,
standing
back
from
the
road
,
with
a
curving
drive
which
was
banked
with
high
evergreen
shrubs
.
it
was
an
old
,
tumbledown
building
in
a
crazy
state
of
disrepair
.
when
the
trap
pulled
up
on
the
grass-grown
drive
in
front
of
the
blotched
and
weather-stained
door
,
i
had
doubts
as
to
my
wisdom
in
visiting
a
man
whom
i
knew
so
slightly
.
he
opened
the
door
himself
,
however
,
and
greeted
me
with
a
great
show
of
cordiality
.
i
was
handed
over
to
the
manservant
,
a
melancholy
,
swarthy
individual
,
who
led
the
way
,
my
bag
in
his
hand
,
to
my
bedroom
.
the
whole
place
was
depressing
.
our
dinner
was
tete-a-tete
,
and
though
my
host
did
his
best
to
be
entertaining
,
his
thoughts
seemed
to
continually
wander
,
and
he
talked
so
vaguely
and
wildly
that
i
could
hardly
understand
him
.
he
continually
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
table
,
gnawed
his
nails
,
and
gave
other
signs
of
nervous
impatience
.
the
dinner
itself
was
neither
well
served
nor
well
cooked
,
and
the
gloomy
presence
of
the
taciturn
servant
did
not
help
to
enliven
us
.

was

well
served
nor
well
cooked
,
and
the
gloomy
presence
of
the
taciturn
servant
did
not

to
enliven
us
.
i
can
assure
you
that
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
wished
that
i
could
invent
some
excuse
which
would
take
me
back
to
lee
.
``
one
thing
comes
back
to
my
memory
which
may
have
a
bearing
upon
the
business
that
you
two
gentlemen
are
investigating
.
i
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
.
near
the
end
of
dinner
a
note
was
handed
in
by
the
servant
.
i
noticed
that
after
my
host
had
read
it
he
seemed
even
more
distrait
and
strange
than
before
.
he
gave
up
all
pretence
at
conversation
and
sat
,
smoking
endless
cigarettes
,
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
,
but
he
made
no
remark
as
to
the
contents
.
about
eleven
i
was
glad
to
go
to
bed
.
some
time
later
garcia
looked
in
at
my
door
--
the
room
was
dark
at
the
time
--
and
asked
me
if
i
had
rung
.
i
said
that
i
had
not
.
he
apologized
for
having
disturbed
me
so
late
,
saying
that
it
was
nearly
one
o'clock
.
i
dropped
off
after
this
and
slept
soundly
all
night
.
``
and
now
i
come
to
the
amazing
part
of
my
tale
.
when
i
woke
it
was
broad
daylight
.
i
glanced
at
my
watch
,
and
the
time
was
nearly
nine
.
i
had
particularly
asked
to
be
called
at
eight
,
so
i
was
very
much
astonished
at
this
forgetfulness
.
i
sprang
up
and
rang
for
the
servant
.
there
was
no
response
.
i
rang
again
and
again
,
with
the
same
result
.
then
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
bell
was
out
of
order
.
i
huddled
on
my
clothes
and
hurried
downstairs
in
an
exceedingly
bad
temper
to
order
some
hot
water
.
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
found
that
there
was
no
one
there
.
i
shouted
in
the
hall
.
there
was
no
answer
.
then
i
ran
from
room
to
room
.
all
were
deserted
.
my
host
had
shown
me
which
was
his
bedroom
the
night
before
,
so
i
knocked
at
the
door
.
no
reply
.
i
turned
the
handle
and
walked
in
.
the
room
was
empty
,
and
the
bed
had
never
been
slept
in
.
he
had
gone
with
the
rest
.
the
foreign
host
,
the
foreign
footman
,
the
foreign
cook
,
all
had
vanished
in
the
night
!
that
was
the
end
of
my
visit
to
wisteria
lodge
.
''
sherlock
holmes
was
rubbing
his
hands
and
chuckling
as
he
added
this
bizarre
incident
to
his
collection
of
strange
episodes
.
``
your
experience
is
,
so
far
as
i
know
,
perfectly
unique
,
''
said
he
.
``
may
i
ask
,
sir
,
what
you
did
then
?
''
``
i
was
furious
.
my
first
idea
was
that
i
had
been
the
victim
of
some
absurd
practical
joke
.
i
packed
my
things
,
banged
the
hall
door
behind
me
,
and
set
off
for
esher
,
with
my
bag
in
my
hand
.
i
called
at
allan
brothers
'
,
the
chief
land
agents
in
the
village
,
and
found
that
it
was
from
this
firm
that
the
villa
had
been
rented
.
it
struck
me
that
the
whole
proceeding
could
hardly
be
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
fool
of
me
,
and
that
the
main
object
must
be
to
get
out
of
the
rent
.
it
is
late
in
march
,
so
quarter-day
is
at
hand
.
but
this
theory
would
not
work
.
the
agent
was
obliged
to
me
for
my
warning
,
but
told
me
that
the
rent
had
been
paid
in
advance
.
then
i
made
my
way
to
town
and
called
at
the
spanish
embassy
.
the
man
was
unknown
there
.
after
this
i
went
to
see
melville
,
at
whose
house
i
had
first
met
garcia
,
but
i
found
that
he
really
knew
rather
less
about
him
than
i
did
.
finally
when
i
got
your
reply
to
my
wire
i
came
out
to
you
,
since
i
gather
that
you
are
a
person
who
gives
advice
in
difficult
cases
.
but
now
,
mr.
inspector
,
i
understand
,
from
what
you
said
when
you
entered
the
room
,
that
you
can
carry
the
story
on
,
and
that
some
tragedy
had
occurred
.
i
can
assure
you
that
every
word
i
have
said
is
the
truth
,
and
that
,
outside
of
what
i
have
told
you
,
i
know
absolutely
nothing
about
the
fate
of
this
man
.
my
only
desire
is
to
help
the
law
in
every
possible
way
.
''
``
i
am
sure
of
it
,
mr.
scott
eccles
--
i
am
sure
of
it
,
''
said
inspector
gregson
in
a
very
amiable
tone
.
``
i
am
bound
to
say
that
everything
which
you
have
said
agrees
very
closely
with
the
facts
as
they
have
come
to
our
notice
.
for
example
,
there
was
that
note
which
arrived
during
dinner
.
did
you
chance
to
observe
what
became
of
it
?
''
``
yes
,
i
did
.
garcia
rolled
it
up
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
.
''
``
what
do
you
say
to
that
,
mr.
baynes
?
''
the
country
detective
was
a
stout
,
puffy
,
red
man
,
whose
face
was
only
redeemed
from
grossness
by
two
extraordinarily
bright
eyes
,
almost
hidden
behind
the
heavy
creases
of
cheek
and
brow
.
with
a
slow
smile
he
drew
a
folded
and
discoloured
scrap
of
paper
from
his
pocket
.
``
it
was
a
dog-grate
,
mr.
holmes
,
and
he
overpitched
it
.
i
picked
this
out
unburned
from
the
back
of
it
.
''
holmes
smiled
his
appreciation
.
``
you
must
have
examined
the
house
very
carefully
to
find
a
single
pellet
of
paper
.
''
``
i
did
,
mr.
holmes
.
it
's
my
way
.
shall
i
read
it
,
mr.
gregson
?
''
the
londoner
nodded
.
``
the
note
is
written
upon
ordinary
cream-laid
paper
without
watermark
.
it
is
a
quarter-sheet
.
the
paper
is
cut
off
in
two
snips
with
a
short-bladed
scissors
.
it
has
been
folded
over
three
times
and
sealed
with
purple
wax
,
put
on
hurriedly
and
pressed
down
with
some
flat
oval
object
.
it
is
addressed
to
mr.
garcia
,
wisteria
lodge
.
it
says
:
``

``
it

a
sharp-pointed
pen
,
but
the
address
is
either
done
with
another
pen
or
by
someone
else

it
is
thicker
and
bolder
,
as
you
see
.
''
``
a
very
remarkable
note

''
said
holmes
,
glancing
it
over
.
``
i
must
compliment
you
,
mr.
baynes
,
upon
your
attention
to
detail
in
your
examination
of
it
.
a
few
trifling
points
might
perhaps
be
added
.
the
oval
seal
is
undoubtedly
a
plain
sleeve-link
--
what
else
is
of
such
a
shape
?
the
scissors
were
bent
nail
scissors
.
short
as
the
two
snips
are
,
you
can
distinctly
see
the
same
slight
curve
in
each
.
''
the
country
detective
chuckled
.
``
i
thought
i
had
squeezed
all
the
juice
out
of
it
,
but
i
see
there
was
a
little
over
,
''
he
said
.
``
i
'm
bound
to
say
that
i
make
nothing
of
the
note
except
that
there
was
something
on
hand
,
and
that
a
woman
,
as
usual
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
''
mr.
scott
eccles
had
fidgeted
in
his
seat
during
this
conversation
.
``
i
am
glad
you
found
the
note
,
since
it
corroborates
my
story
,
''
said
he
.
``
but
i
beg
to
point
out
that
i

not

heard

has
become
of

``
as
to
garcia
,
''
said
gregson
,
``
that
is
easily
answered
.
he
was
found
dead
this
morning
upon
oxshott
common
,
nearly
a
mile
from
his
home
.
his
head
had
been
smashed
to
pulp
by
heavy
blows
of
a
sandbag
or
some
such
instrument
,
which
had
crushed
rather
than
wounded
.
it
is
a
lonely
corner
,
and
there
is
no
house
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
spot
.
he
had
apparently
been
struck
down
first
from
behind
,
but
his
assailant
had
gone
on
beating
him
long
after
he
was
dead
.
it
was
a
most
furious
assault
.
there
are
no
footsteps

any
clue
to
the
criminals

''
``
no

there

``
no

``
this
is
very
painful

very
painful

terrible

said
mr.
scott
eccles
in
a
querulous
voice
,
``
but
it
is
really
uncommonly
hard
on
me

i
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
host
going
off
upon
a
nocturnal
excursion
and
meeting
so
sad
an
end

how
do
i
come
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
case
?
''
``
very
simply
,
sir
,
''
inspector
baynes
answered
.
``
the
only
document
found
in
the
pocket
of
the
deceased
was
a
letter
from
you
saying
that
you
would
be
with
him
on
the
night
of
his
death
.
it
was
the
envelope
of
this
letter
which
gave
us
the
dead
man
's
name
and
address
.
it
was
after
nine
this
morning
when
we
reached
his
house
and
found
neither
you
nor
anyone
else
inside
it
.
i
wired
to
mr.
gregson
to
run
you
down
in
london
while
i
examined
wisteria
lodge
.
then
i
came
into
town
,
joined
mr.
gregson
,
and
here
we
are
.
''
``
i
think
now
,
''
said
gregson
,
rising
,
``
we
had
best
put
this
matter
into
an
official
shape

you
will
come
round
with
us
to
the
station

mr.
scott
eccles

let
us
have
your
statement
in
writing

``

will
come

retain
your
services

mr.
holmes
.
i
desire
you
to
spare
no
expense
and
no
pains
to
get
at
the
truth

''
my
friend
turned
to
the
country
inspector
.
``
i
suppose
that
you
have
no
objection
to
my
collaborating
with
you
,
mr.
baynes
?
''
``
highly
honoured
,
sir
,
i
am
sure

''
``
you
appear
to
have
been
very
prompt
and
businesslike
in
all
that
you
have
done

was
there
any
clue
,
may
i
ask
,
as
to
the
exact
hour
that
the
man
met
his
death
?
''
``
he
had
been
there
since
one
o'clock
.
there
was
rain
about
that
time
,
and
his
death
had
certainly
been
before
the
rain
.
''
``
but
that
is
perfectly
impossible
,
mr.
baynes
,
''
cried
our
client
.
``
his
voice
is
unmistakable
.
i
could
swear
to
it
that
it
was
he
who
addressed
me
in
my
bedroom
at
that
very
hour

``
remarkable

asked
gregson
.
``
on
the
face
of
it
the
case

not
a
very
complex
one
,
though
it
certainly
presents
some
novel
and
interesting
features
.
a
further
knowledge
of
facts
is
necessary
before
i
would
venture
to
give
a
final
and
definite
opinion
.
by
the
way
,
mr.
baynes
,
did
you
find
anything
remarkable
besides
this
note
in
your
examination
of
the
house
?
''
the
detective
looked
at
my
friend
in
a
singular
way
.
``
there
were
,
''
said
he
,
``
one
or
two
very
remarkable
things
.
perhaps
when
i
have
finished
at
the
police-station
you
would
care
to
come
out
and
give
me
your
opinion
of
them
.
''
``
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
,
''
said
sherlock
holmes
,
ringing
the
bell
.
``
you
will
show
these
gentlemen
out
,
mrs.
hudson
,
and
kindly
send
the
boy
with
this
telegram

he
is
to
pay
a
five-shilling
reply

''
we
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
after
our
visitors
had
left
.
holmes
smoked
hard
,
with
his
browns
drawn
down
over
his
keen
eyes
,
and
his
head
thrust
forward
in
the
eager
way
characteristic
of
the
man
.
``
well
,
watson
,
''
he
asked
,
turning
suddenly
upon
me
,
``
what
do
you
make
of
it
?
''
``
i
can
make
nothing
of
this
mystification
of
scott
eccles
.

``
but
the
crime
?
''
``
well
,
taken
with
the
disappearance
of
the
man
's
companions
,
i
should
say
that
they
were
in
some
way
concerned
in
the
murder
and
had
fled
from
justice
.
''
``
that
is
certainly
a
possible
point
of
view
.
on
the
face
of
it
you
must
admit
,
however
,
that
it
is
very
strange
that
his
two
servants
should
have
been
in
a
conspiracy
against
him
and
should
have
attacked
him
on
the
one
night
when
he
had
a
guest
.
they
had
him
alone
at
their
mercy
every
other
night
in
the
week
.
''
``
then
why
did
they
fly
?
''
``
quite
so
.
why
did
they
fly
?
there
is
a
big
fact
.
another
big
fact
is
the
remarkable
experience
of
our
client
,
scott
eccles
.
now
,
my
dear
watson
,
is
it
beyond
the
limits
of
human
ingenuity
to
furnish
an
explanation
which
would
cover
both
of
these
big
facts
?
if
it
were
one
which
would
also
admit
of
the
mysterious
note
with
its
very
curious
phraseology
,
why
,
then
it
would
be
worth
accepting
as
a
temporary
hypothesis
.
if
the
fresh
facts
which
come
to
our
knowledge
all
fit
themselves
into
the
scheme
,
then
our
hypothesis
may
gradually
become
a
solution
.
''
``
but
what
is
our
hypothesis
?
''
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
half-closed
eyes
.
``
you
must
admit
,
my
dear
watson
,
that
the
idea
of
a
joke
is
impossible
.
there
were
grave
events
afoot
,
as
the
sequel
showed
,
and
the
coaxing
of
scott
eccles
to
wisteria
lodge
had
some
connection
with
them
.
''
``
but
what
possible
connection
?
''
``
let
us
take
it
link
by
link
.
there
is
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
something
unnatural
about
this
strange
and
sudden
friendship
between
the
young
spaniard
and
scott
eccles
.
it
was
the
former
who
forced
the
pace
.
he
called
upon
eccles
at
the
other
end
of
london
on
the
very
day
after
he
first
met
him
,
and
he
kept
in
close
touch
with
him
until
he
got
him
down
to
esher
.
now
,
what
did
he
want
with
eccles
?
what
could
eccles
supply
?
i
see
no
charm
in
the
man
.
he
is
not
particularly
intelligent
--
not
a
man
likely
to
be
congenial
to
a
quick-witted
latin

why
,
then
,
was
he
picked
out
from
all
the
other
people
whom
garcia
met
as
particularly
suited
to
his
purpose
?
has
he
any
one
outstanding
quality
?
i
say
that
he
has
.
he
is
the
very
type
of
conventional
british
respectability
,
and
the
very
man
as
a
witness
to
impress
another
briton
.
you
saw
yourself
how
neither
of
the
inspectors
dreamed
of
questioning
his
statement
,
extraordinary
as
it
was
.
''
``
but
what
was
he
to
witness
?
''
``
nothing
,
as
things
turned
out
,
but
everything
had
they
gone
another
way
.
that
is
how
i
read
the
matter

''
``
i

,
he
might
have
proved
an
alibi

''
``
exactly
,
my
dear
watson
;
he
might
have
proved
an
alibi
.
we
will
suppose
,
for
argument
's
sake
,
that
the
household
of
wisteria
lodge
are
confederates
in
some
design
.
the
attempt
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
is
to
come
off
,
we
will
say
,
before
one
o'clock
.
by
some
juggling
of
the
clocks
it
is
quite
possible
that
they
may
have
got
scott
eccles
to
bed
earlier
than
he
thought
,
but
in
any
case
it
is
likely
that
when
garcia
went
out
of
his
way
to
tell
him
that
it
was
one
it
was
really
not
more
than
twelve
.
if
garcia
could
do
whatever
he
had
to
do
and
be
back
by
the
hour
mentioned
he
had
evidently
a
powerful
reply
to
any
accusation
.
here
was
this
irreproachable
englishman
ready
to
swear
in
any
court
of
law
that
the
accused
was
in
the
house
all
the
time
.
it
was
an
insurance
against
the
worst
.

yes

yes

i
see
that

how
about
the
disappearance
of
the
others

it

''
an
answer
had
arrived
to
holmes
's
telegram
before
our
surrey
officer
had
returned
.
holmes
read
it
and
was
about
to
place
it
in
his
notebook
when
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
my
expectant
face
.
he
tossed
it
across
with
a
laugh
.
``
we
are
moving
in
exalted
circles
,
''
said
he
.
the
telegram
was
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
:

``
this
is
a
very
obvious
way
of
limiting
our
field
of
operations
,
''
said
holmes
.
``
no
doubt
baynes
,
with
his
methodical
mind
,
has
already
adopted
some

``

do
n't
quite

''
``
well
,
my
dear
fellow
,
we
have
already
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
message
received
by
garcia
at
dinner
was
an
appointment
or
an
assignation
.
now
,
if
the
obvious
reading
of
it
is
correct
,
and
in
order
to
keep
the
tryst
one
has
to
ascend
a
main
stair
and
seek
the
seventh
door
in
a
corridor
,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
house
is
a
very
large
one
.
it
is
equally
certain
that
this
house
can
not
be
more
than
a
mile
or
two
from
oxshott
,
since
garcia
was
walking
in
that
direction
and
hoped
,
according
to
my
reading
of
the
facts
,
to
be
back
in
wisteria
lodge
in
time
to
avail
himself
of
an
alibi
,
which
would
only
be
valid
up
to
one
o'clock
.
as
the
number
of
large
houses
close
to
oxshott
must
be
limited
,
i
adopted
the
obvious
method
of
sending
to
the
agents
mentioned
by
scott
eccles
and
obtaining
a
list
of
them
.
here
they
are
in
this
telegram
,
and
the
other
end
of
our
tangled
skein
must
lie
among
them
.
''
it
was
nearly
six
o'clock
before
we
found
ourselves
in
the
pretty
surrey
village
of
esher
,
with
inspector
baynes
as
our
companion
.
holmes
and
i
had
taken
things
for
the
night
,
and
found
comfortable
quarters
at
the
bull
.
finally
we
set
out
in
the
company
of
the
detective
on
our
visit
to
wisteria
lodge
.
it
was
a
cold
,
dark
march
evening
,
with
a
sharp
wind
and
a
fine
rain
beating
upon
our
faces
,
a
fit
setting
for
the
wild
common
over
which
our
road
passed
and
the
tragic
goal
to
which
it
led
us
.
2.
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
a
cold
and
melancholy
walk
of
a
couple
of
miles
brought
us
to
a
high
wooden
gate
,
which
opened
into
a
gloomy
avenue
of
chestnuts
.
the
curved
and
shadowed
drive
led
us
to
a
low
,
dark
house
,
pitch-black
against
a
slate-coloured
sky
.
from
the
front
window
upon
the
left
of
the
door
there
peeped
a
glimmer
of
a
feeble
light
.
``
there
's
a
constable
in
possession
,
''
said
baynes
.
``
i
'll
knock
at
the
window
.
''
he
stepped
across
the
grass
plot
and
tapped
with
his
hand
on
the
pane
.
through
the
fogged
glass
i
dimly
saw
a
man
spring
up
from
a
chair
beside
the
fire
,
and
heard
a
sharp
cry
from
within
the
room
.
an
instant
later
a
white-faced
,
hard-breathing
policeman
had
opened
the
door
,
the
candle
wavering
in
his
trembling
hand
.
``
what
's
the
matter
,
walters
?
''
asked
baynes
sharply
.
the
man
mopped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
and
gave
a
long
sigh
of
relief
.
``
i
am
glad
you
have
come
,
sir
.
it
has
been
a
long
evening
,
and
i
do
n't

my
nerve

as
good
as
it
was
.

``

nerve

i
should
not

''
``
well
,
sir
,
it
's
this
lonely
,
silent
house
and
the
queer
thing
in
the
kitchen

then
when
you
tapped
at
the
window
i
thought
it
had
come
again
.
''
``
that
what
had
come
again
?
''
``

was
at

``

was
at

and
when
?

``
it
was
just
about
two
hours
ago

the
light
was
just
fading

i
was
sitting
reading
in
the
chair
.
i
do
n't
know
what
made
me
look
up

there
was
a
face
looking
in
at
me
through
the
lower
pane
.

it
was

i
'll
see
it
in

dreams

is

it
shook
me
,
sir

and
there
's
no
use
to
deny
it
.
it
was
n't
black
,
sir
,
nor
was
it
white
,

``

is
very
easily

said
holmes
,
lighting
his
little
pocket
lantern
.

he
reported
,
after
a
short
examination
of
the
grass
bed
,

``

seems
to
have
broken

``

said
the
inspector
with
a
grave
and
thoughtful
face
,
``

may
have

's
gone

have
more
immediate
things
to
attend

now
,
mr.
holmes
,
with
your
permission
,
i
will
show
you
round
the
house
.
''
the
various
bedrooms
and
sitting-rooms
had
yielded
nothing
to
a
careful
search
.
apparently
the
tenants
had
brought
little
or
nothing
with
them
,
and
all
the
furniture
down
to
the
smallest
details
had
been
taken
over
with
the
house
.
a
good
deal
of
clothing
with
the
stamp
of
marx
and
co.
,
high
holborn
,
had
been
left
behind
.
telegraphic
inquiries
had
been
already
made
which
showed
that
marx
knew
nothing
of
his
customer
save
that
he
was
a
good
payer
.
odds
and
ends
,
some
pipes
,
a
few
novels
,
two
of
them
in
spanish
,
an
old-fashioned
pinfire
revolver
,
and
a
guitar
were
among
the
personal
property
.
``
nothing
in
all
this
,
''
said
baynes
,
stalking
,
candle
in
hand
,
from
room
to
room
.
``
but
now
,
mr.
holmes
,
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
kitchen
.
''
it
was
a
gloomy
,
high-ceilinged
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
with
a
straw
litter
in
one
corner
,
which
served
apparently
as
a
bed
for
the
cook
.
the
table
was
piled
with
half-eaten
dishes
and
dirty
plates
,
the
debris
of
last
night
's
dinner
.
``
look
at
this
,
''
said
baynes
.
``
what
do
you
make
of
it
?
''
he
held
up
his
candle
before
an
extraordinary
object
which
stood
at
the
back
of
the
dresser
.
it
was
so
wrinkled
and
shrunken
and
withered
that
it
was
difficult
to
say
what
it
might
have
been
.
one
could
but
say
that
it
was
black
and
leathery
and
that
it
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
dwarfish
,
human
figure
.
at
first
,
as
i
examined
it
,
i
thought
that
it
was
a
mummified
negro
baby
,
and
then
it
seemed
a
very
twisted
and
ancient
monkey
.
finally
i
was
left
in
doubt
as
to
whether
it
was
animal
or
human
.
a
double
band
of
white
shells
were
strung
round
the
centre
of
it
.
``
very
interesting
--
very
interesting
,
indeed
!
''
said
holmes
,
peering
at
this
sinister
relic
.
``
anything
more
?
''
in
silence
baynes
led
the
way
to
the
sink
and
held
forward
his
candle
.
the
limbs
and
body
of
some
large
,
white
bird
,
torn
savagely
to
pieces
with
the
feathers
still
on
,
were
littered
all
over
it
.
holmes
pointed
to
the
wattles
on
the
severed
head
.
``
a
white
cock
,
''
said
he
.
``
most
interesting
!
it
is
really
a
very
curious
case
.
''
but
mr.
baynes
had
kept
his
most
sinister
exhibit
to
the
last
.
from
under
the
sink
he
drew
a
zinc
pail
which
contained
a
quantity
of
blood
.
then
from
the
table
he
took
a
platter
heaped
with
small
pieces
of
charred
bone
.
``
something
has
been
killed
and
something
has
been
burned
.
we
raked
all
these
out
of
the
fire
.
we
had
a
doctor
in
this
morning
.
he
says
that
they
are
not
human
.
''
holmes
smiled
and
rubbed
his
hands
.
``
i
must
congratulate
you
,
inspector
,
on
handling
so
distinctive
and
instructive
a
case
.
your
powers

if
i
may
say
so
without
offence
,
seem
superior
to
your
opportunities

inspector
baynes
's
small
eyes
twinkled
with
pleasure
.
``
you
're
right
,
mr.
holmes
.
we
stagnate
in
the
provinces

a
case
of
this
sort
gives
a
man
a
chance

i
hope
that
i
shall
take
it

what
do
you
make

bones

``

``

``

must
have
been

very
strange
people

very
strange
ways
in

is
dead

did
his
companions
follow
him

kill
him

own
views
are
very
different

``
you
have
a
theory
then
?
''
``
and
i
'll
work
it
myself
,
mr.
holmes
.
it
's
only
due
to
my
own
credit
to
do
so
.
your
name
is
made
,
but
i
have
still
to
make
mine
.
i
should
be
glad
to
be
able
to
say
afterwards
that
i
had
solved
it
without
your
help

''
holmes
laughed
good-humoredly
.
``
well
,
well
,
inspector
,
''
said
he
.
``
do
you
follow
your
path

i
will
follow
mine

my
results
are
always
very
much
at
your
service

you
care
to
apply
to
me
for
them

i
think
that
i
have
seen
all
that
i
wish
in

house

that
my
time
may
be
more
profitably
employed
elsewhere

luck

''
i
could
tell
by
numerous
subtle
signs
,
which
might
have
been
lost
upon
anyone
but
myself
,
that
holmes
was
on
a
hot
scent
.
as
impassive
as
ever
to
the
casual
observer
,
there
were
none
the
less
a
subdued
eagerness
and
suggestion
of
tension
in
his
brightened
eyes
and
brisker
manner
which
assured
me
that
the
game
was
afoot
.
after
his
habit
he
said
nothing

after
mine
i
asked
no
questions

my

took
no

one
morning
he
spent
in

i
learned
from
a
casual
reference
that
he
had
visited
the
british
museum
.
save
for
this
one
excursion
,
he
spent
his
days
in
long
and
often
solitary
walks
,
or
in
chatting
with
a
number
of
village
gossips
whose
acquaintance
he
had
cultivated
.
``

'm

week
in

country

be
invaluable

he
remarked
.

shoots
upon

hedges

he
prowled
about
with
this
equipment
himself
,
but
it
was
a
poor
show
of
plants
which
he
would
bring
back
of
an
evening
.
occasionally
in
our
rambles
we
came
across
inspector
baynes
.
his
fat
,
red
face
wreathed
itself
in
smiles
and
his
small
eyes
glittered
as
he
greeted
my
companion
.
he
said
little
about
the
case
,
but
from
that
little
we
gathered
that
he
also
was
not
dissatisfied
at
the

i
must
admit
,
however
,
that
i
was
somewhat
surprised
when
,
some
five
days
after
the
crime
,
i
opened
my
morning
paper
to
find
in
large
letters
:
the
oxshott
mystery
a
solution
arrest
of
supposed
assassin
holmes
sprang
in
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
stung
when
i
read
the
headlines
.
``
by
jove
!
''
he
cried
.
``
you
do
n't
mean
that
baynes
has
got
him
?
''
``
apparently
,
''
said
i
as
i
read
the
following
report
:
``
great
excitement
was
caused
in
esher
and
the
neighbouring
district
when
it
was
learned
late
last
night
that
an
arrest
had
been
effected
in
connection
with
the
oxshott
murder
.
it
will
be
remembered
that
mr.
garcia
,
of
wisteria
lodge
,
was
found
dead
on
oxshott
common
,
his
body
showing
signs
of
extreme
violence
,
and
that
on
the
same
night
his
servant
and
his
cook
fled
,
which
appeared
to
show
their
participation
in
the
crime
.
it
was
suggested
,
but
never
proved
,
that
the
deceased
gentleman
may
have
had
valuables
in
the
house
,
and
that
their
abstraction
was
the
motive
of
the
crime
.
every
effort
was
made
by
inspector
baynes
,
who
has
the
case
in
hand
,
to
ascertain
the
hiding
place
of
the
fugitives
,
and
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
they
had
not
gone
far
but
were
lurking
in
some
retreat
which
had
been
already
prepared
.
it
was
certain
from
the
first
,
however
,
that
they
would
eventually
be
detected
,
as
the
cook
,
from
the
evidence
of
one
or
two
tradespeople
who
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
through
the
window
,
was
a
man
of
most
remarkable
appearance
--
being
a
huge
and
hideous
mulatto
,
with
yellowish
features
of
a
pronounced
negroid
type
.
this
man
has
been
seen
since
the
crime
,
for
he
was
detected
and
pursued
by
constable
walters
on
the
same
evening
,
when
he
had
the
audacity
to
revisit
wisteria
lodge
.
inspector
baynes
,
considering
that
such
a
visit
must
have
some
purpose
in
view
and
was
likely
,
therefore
,
to
be
repeated
,
abandoned
the
house
but
left
an
ambuscade
in
the
shrubbery
.
the
man
walked
into
the
trap
and
was
captured
last
night
after
a
struggle
in
which
constable
downing
was
badly
bitten
by
the
savage
.
we
understand
that
when
the
prisoner
is
brought
before
the
magistrates
a
remand
will
be
applied
for
by
the
police
,
and
that
great
developments
are
hoped
from
his
capture
.
''
``
really
we
must
see
baynes
at
once
,
''
cried
holmes
,
picking
up
his
hat
.
``
we
will
just
catch
him
before
he
starts
.
''
we
hurried
down
the
village
street
and
found
,
as
we
had
expected
,
that
the
inspector
was
just
leaving
his
lodgings
.
``
you
've
seen
the
paper
,
mr.
holmes
?
''
he
asked
,
holding
one
out
to
us
.
``
yes
,
baynes
,
i
've
seen
it
.
pray
do
n't
think
it
a
liberty
if
i
give
you
a
word
of
friendly
warning
.
''
``
of
warning
,
mr.
holmes
?
''
``
i
have
looked
into
this
case
with
some
care
,
and
i
am
not
convinced
that
you
are
on
the
right
lines
.
i
do
n't
want
you
to
commit
yourself
too
far
unless
you
are
sure
.
''
``
you
're
very
kind
,
mr.
holmes
.
''
``
i
assure
you
i
speak
for
your
good
.
''
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
like
a
wink
quivered
for
an
instant
over
one
of
mr.
baynes
's
tiny
eyes
.
``
we
agreed
to
work
on
our
own
lines
,
mr.
holmes
.
that
's
what
i
am
doing
.
''
``
oh
,
very
good
,
''
said
holmes
.
``
do
n't
blame
me
.
''
``
no
,
sir
;
i
believe
you
mean
well
by
me
.
but
we
all
have
our
own
systems

mr.
holmes
.
you
have
yours
,
and
maybe
i
have
mine
.
''
``
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
.
''
``
you
're
welcome
always
to
my
news
.
this
fellow
is
a
perfect
savage
,
as
strong
as
a
cart-horse
and
as
fierce
as
the
devil
.
he
chewed
downing
's
thumb
nearly
off
before
they
could
master
him
.
he
hardly
speaks
a
word
of
english
,
and
we
can
get
nothing
out
of
him
but
grunts
.
''
``
and
you
think
you
have
evidence
that
he
murdered
his
late
master
?
''
``
i
did
n't

so

mr.
holmes
;
i
did

little
ways

yours

that
's
the
agreement
.
''
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
we
walked
away
together
.
``
i
ca
n't
make
the
man
out
.
he
seems
to
be
riding
for
a
fall
.
well
,
as
he
says
,
we
must
each
try
our
own
way
and
see
what
comes
of
it
.
but
there
's
something
in
inspector
baynes
which
i
ca
n't
quite
understand
.
''
``
just
sit
down
in
that
chair
,
watson
,
''
said
sherlock
holmes
when
we
had
returned
to
our
apartment
at
the
bull
.
``
i
want
to
put
you
in
touch
with
the
situation
,
as
i
may
need
your
help
to-night
.
let
me
show
you
the
evolution
of
this
case
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
follow
it
.
simple
as
it
has
been
in
its
leading
features
,
it
has
none
the
less
presented
surprising
difficulties
in
the
way
of
an
arrest
.
there
are
gaps
in
that
direction
which
we
have
still
to
fill
.
``
we
will
go
back
to
the
note
which
was
handed
in
to
garcia
upon
the
evening
of
his
death
.
we
may
put
aside
this
idea
of
baynes
's
that
garcia
's
servants
were
concerned
in
the
matter
.
the
proof
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
was
he
who
had
arranged
for
the
presence
of
scott
eccles
,
which
could
only
have
been
done
for
the
purpose
of
an
alibi
.
it
was
garcia
,
then
,
who
had
an
enterprise
,
and
apparently
a
criminal
enterprise
,
in
hand
that
night
in
the
course
of
which
he
met
his
death
.
i
say
`
criminal
'
because
only
a
man
with
a
criminal
enterprise
desires
to
establish
an
alibi
.
who
,
then
,
is
most
likely
to
have
taken
his
life
?
surely
the
person
against
whom
the
criminal
enterprise
was
directed
.
so
far
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
on
safe
ground
.
``
we
can
now
see
a
reason
for
the
disappearance
of
garcia
's
household
.
they
were
all
confederates
in
the
same
unknown
crime
.
if
it
came
off
when
garcia
returned
,
any
possible
suspicion
would
be
warded
off
by
the
englishman
's
evidence
,
and
all
would
be
well
.
but
the
attempt
was
a
dangerous
one
,
and
if
garcia
did
not
return
by
a
certain
hour
it
was
probable
that
his
own
life
had
been
sacrificed
.
it
had
been
arranged
,
therefore
,
that
in
such
a
case
his
two
subordinates
were
to
make
for
some
prearranged
spot
where
they
could
escape
investigation
and
be
in
a
position
afterwards
to
renew
their
attempt
.
that
would
fully
explain
the
facts
,
would
it
not
?
''
the
whole
inexplicable
tangle
seemed
to
straighten
out
before
me
.
i
wondered
,
as
i
always
did
,
how
it
had
not
been
obvious
to
me
before
.
``
but
why
should
one
servant
return
?
''
``
we
can
imagine
that
in
the
confusion
of
flight
something
precious
,
something
which
he
could
not
bear
to
part
with
,
had
been
left
behind
.
that
would
explain
his
persistence
,
would
it
not
?
''
``
well
,
what
is
the
next
step
?
''
``
the
next
step
is
the
note
received
by
garcia
at
the
dinner
.
it
indicates
a
confederate
at
the
other
end
.
now
,
where
was
the
other
end
?
i
have
already
shown
you
that
it
could
only
lie
in
some
large
house
,
and
that
the
number
of
large
houses
is
limited
.
my
first
days
in
this
village
were
devoted
to
a
series
of
walks
in
which
in
the
intervals
of
my
botanical
researches
i
made
a
reconnaissance
of
all
the
large
houses
and
an
examination
of
the
family
history
of
the
occupants
.
one
house
,
and
only
one
,
riveted
my
attention
.
it
is
the
famous
old
jacobean
grange
of
high
gable
,
one
mile
on
the
farther
side
of
oxshott
,
and
less
than
half
a
mile
from
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
.
the
other
mansions
belonged
to
prosaic
and
respectable
people
who
live
far
aloof
from
romance
.
but
mr.
henderson
,
of
high
gable
,
was
by
all
accounts
a
curious
man
to
whom
curious
adventures
might
befall
.
i
concentrated
my
attention
,
therefore
,
upon
him
and
his
household
.
``
a
singular
set
of
people
,
watson
--
the
man
himself
the
most
singular
of
them
all
.
i
managed
to
see
him
on
a
plausible
pretext
,
but
i
seemed
to
read
in
his
dark
,
deepset
,
brooding
eyes
that
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
my
true
business
.
he
is
a
man
of
fifty
,
strong
,
active
,
with
iron-gray
hair
,
great
bunched
black
eyebrows
,
the
step
of
a
deer
and
the
air
of
an
emperor
--
a
fierce
,
masterful
man
,
with
a
red-hot
spirit
behind
his
parchment
face
.
he
is
either
a
foreigner
or
has
lived
long
in
the
tropics
,
for
he
is
yellow
and
sapless
,
but
tough
as
whipcord
.
his
friend
and
secretary
,
mr.
lucas
,
is
undoubtedly
a
foreigner
,
chocolate
brown
,
wily
,
suave
,
and
catlike
,
with
a
poisonous
gentleness
of
speech
.
you
see
,
watson
,
we
have
come
already
upon
two
sets
of
foreigners
--
one
at
wisteria
lodge
and
one
at
high
gable
--
so
our
gaps
are
beginning
to
close
.
``
these
two
men
,
close
and
confidential
friends
,
are
the
centre
of
the
household
;
but
there
is
one
other
person
who
for
our
immediate
purpose
may
be
even
more
important
.
henderson
has
two
children
--
girls
of
eleven
and
thirteen
.
their
governess
is
a
miss
burnet
,
an
englishwoman
of
forty
or
thereabouts
.
there
is
also
one
confidential
manservant
.
this
little
group
forms
the
real
family
,
for
they
travel
about
together
,
and
henderson
is
a
great
traveller
,
always
on
the
move
.
it
is
only
within
the
last
weeks
that
he
has
returned
,
after
a
year
's
absence
,
to
high
gable
.
i
may
add
that
he
is
enormously
rich
,
and
whatever
his
whims
may
be
he
can
very
easily
satisfy
them
.
for
the
rest
,
his
house
is
full
of
butlers
,
footmen
,
maidservants
,
and
the
usual
overfed
,
underworked
staff
of
a
large
english
country
house
.
``
so
much
i
learned
partly
from
village
gossip
and
partly
from
my
own
observation
.
there
are
no
better
instruments
than
discharged
servants
with
a
grievance
,
and
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
one
.
i
call
it
luck
,
but
it
would
not
have
come
my
way
had
i
not
been
looking
out
for
it
.
i
call
it
luck
,
but
it
would
not
have
come
my
way
had
i
not
been
looking
out
for
it
.
as
baynes
remarks
,
we
all
have
our
systems
.
it
was
my
system
which
enabled
me
to
find
john
warner
,
late
gardener
of
high
gable
,
sacked
in
a
moment
of
temper
by
his
imperious
employer
.
he
in
turn
had
friends
among
the
indoor
servants
who
unite
in
their
fear
and
dislike
of
their
master
.
so
i
had
my
key
to
the
secrets
of
the
establishment
.
``
curious
people
,
watson
!
i
do
n't
pretend
to
understand
it
all
yet
,
but
very
curious
people
anyway
.
it
's
a
double-winged
house
,
and
the
servants
live
on
one
side
,
the
family
on
the
other
.
there
's
no
link
between
the
two
save
for
henderson
's
own
servant
,
who
serves
the
family
's
meals
.
everything
is
carried
to
a
certain
door
,
which
forms
the
one
connection
.
governess
and
children
hardly
go
out
at
all
,
except
into
the
garden
.
henderson
never
by
any
chance
walks
alone
.
his
dark
secretary
is
like
his
shadow
.
the
gossip
among
the
servants
is
that
their
master
is
terribly
afraid
of
something
.
`
sold
his
soul
to
the
devil
in
exchange
for
money
,
'
says
warner
,
`
and
expects
his
creditor
to
come
up
and
claim
his
own
.
'
where
they
came
from
,
or
who
they
are
,
nobody
has
an
idea
.
they
are
very
violent
.
twice
henderson
has
lashed
at
folk
with
his
dog-whip
,
and
only
his
long
purse
and
heavy
compensation
have
kept
him
out
of
the
courts
.
``
well
,
now
,
watson
,
let
us
judge
the
situation
by
this
new
information
.
we
may
take
it
that
the
letter
came
out
of
this
strange
household
and
was
an
invitation
to
garcia
to
carry
out
some
attempt
which
had
already
been
planned
.
who
wrote
the
note
?
it
was
someone
within
the
citadel
,
and
it
was
a
woman
.
who
then
but
miss
burnet
,
the
governess
?
all
our
reasoning
seems
to
point
that
way
.
at
any
rate
,
we
may
take
it
as
a
hypothesis
and
see
what
consequences
it
would
entail
.
i
may
add
that
miss
burnet
's
age
and
character
make
it
certain
that
my
first
idea
that
there
might
be
a
love
interest
in
our
story
is
out
of
the
question
.
``
if
she
wrote
the
note
she
was
presumably
the
friend
and
confederate
of
garcia
.
what
,
then
,
might
she
be
expected
to
do
if
she
heard
of
his
death
?
if
he
met
it
in
some
nefarious
enterprise
her
lips
might
be
sealed
.
still
,
in
her
heart
,
she
must
retain
bitterness
and
hatred
against
those
who
had
killed
him
and
would
presumably
help
so
far
as
she
could
to
have
revenge
upon
them
.
could
we
see
her
,
then
and
try
to
use
her
?
that
was
my
first
thought
.
but
now
we
come
to
a
sinister
fact
.
miss
burnet
has
not
been
seen
by
any
human
eye
since
the
night
of
the
murder
.
from
that
evening
she
has
utterly
vanished
.
is
she
alive

has
she
perhaps
met
her
end
on
the
same
night
as
the
friend
whom
she
had
summoned
?
or
is
she
merely
a
prisoner
?
there
is
the
point
which
we
still
have
to
decide
.
``
you
will
appreciate
the
difficulty
of
the
situation
,
watson
.
there
is
nothing
upon
which
we
can
apply
for
a
warrant
.
our
whole
scheme
might
seem
fantastic
if
laid
before
a
magistrate
.
the
woman
's
disappearance
counts
for
nothing
,
since
in
that
extraordinary
household
any
member
of
it
might
be
invisible
for
a
week
.

all
i
can

to

on

at
the
gates

we

n't
let
such
a

continue

if
the

can

we
must
take
the
risk
ourselves
.
''
``
what
do
you
suggest
?
''
``
i
know
which
is
her
room
.
it
is
accessible
from
the
top
of
an
outhouse
.
my
suggestion
is
that
you
and
i
go
to-night
and
see
if
we
can
strike
at
the
very
heart
of
the
mystery
.
''
it
was
not
,
i
must
confess
,
a
very
alluring
prospect
.
the
old
house
with
its
atmosphere
of
murder
,
the
singular
and
formidable
inhabitants
,
the
unknown
dangers
of
the
approach
,
and
the
fact
that
we
were
putting
ourselves
legally
in
a
false
position
all
combined
to
damp
my
ardour
.
but
there
was
something
in
the
ice-cold
reasoning
of
holmes
which
made
it
impossible
to
shrink
from
any
adventure
which
he
might
recommend
.
one
knew
that
thus
,
and
only
thus
,
could
a
solution
be
found
.
i
clasped
his
hand
in
silence
,
and
the
die
was
cast
.
but
it
was
not
destined
that
our
investigation
should
have
so
adventurous
an
ending
.
it
was
about
five
o'clock
,
and
the
shadows
of
the
march
evening
were
beginning
to
fall
,
when
an
excited
rustic
rushed
into
our
room
.
``
they
've
gone
,
mr.
holmes
.
they
went
by
the
last
train
.
the
lady
broke
away
,
and
i
've
got
her
in
a
cab
downstairs
.
''
``
excellent
,
warner
!
''
cried
holmes
,
springing
to
his
feet
.
``
watson
,
the
gaps
are
closing
rapidly
.
''
in
the
cab
was
a
woman
,
half-collapsed
from
nervous
exhaustion
.
she
bore
upon
her
aquiline
and
emaciated
face
the
traces
of
some
recent
tragedy
.
her
head
hung
listlessly
upon
her
breast
,
but
as
she
raised
it
and
turned
her
dull
eyes
upon
us
i
saw
that
her
pupils
were
dark
dots
in
the
centre
of
the
broad
gray
iris
.
she
was
drugged
with
opium
.
``
i
watched
at
the
gate
,
same
as
you
advised
,
mr.
holmes
,
''
said
our
emissary
,
the
discharged
gardener
.
``
when
the
carriage
came
out
i
followed
it
to
the
station
.
she
was
like
one
walking
in
her
sleep
,
but
when
they
tried
to
get
her
into
the
train
she
came
to
life
and
struggled
.
they
pushed
her
into
the
carriage
.
she
fought
her
way
out
again
.
i
took
her
part
,
got
her
into
a
cab
,
and
here
we
are
.
i
sha
n't
forget
the
face
at
the
carriage
window
as
i
led
her
away
.
i
'd
have
a
short
life
if
he
had
his
way
--
the
black-eyed
,
scowling
,
yellow
devil
.
''
we
carried
her
upstairs
,
laid
her
on
the
sofa
,
and
a
couple
of
cups
of
the
strongest
coffee
soon
cleared
her
brain
from
the
mists
of
the
drug
.
baynes
had
been
summoned
by
holmes
,
and
the
situation
rapidly
explained
to
him
.
``
why
,
sir
,
you
've
got
me
the
very
evidence
i
want
,
''
said
the
inspector
warmly
,
shaking
my
friend
by
the
hand
.
``
i
was
on
the
same
scent
as
you
from
the
first
.
''
``
what
!
you
were
after
henderson
?
''
``
why
,
mr.
holmes
,
when
you
were
crawling
in
the
shrubbery
at
high
gable
i
was
up
one
of
the
trees
in
the
plantation
and
saw
you
down
below
.
it
was
just
who
would
get
his
evidence
first
.
''
``
then
why
did
you
arrest
the
mulatto
?
''
baynes
chuckled
.
``
i
was
sure
henderson
,
as
he
calls
himself
,
felt
that
he
was
suspected
,
and
that
he
would
lie
low
and
make
no
move
so
long
as
he
thought
he
was
in
any
danger
.
i
arrested
the
wrong
man
to
make
him
believe
that
our
eyes
were
off
him
.
i
knew
he
would
be
likely
to
clear
off
then
and
give
us
a
chance
of
getting
at
miss
burnet
.
''
holmes
laid
his
hand
upon
the
inspector
's
shoulder
.
``
you
will
rise
high
in
your
profession
.
you
have
instinct
and
intuition
,
''
said
he
.
baynes
flushed
with
pleasure
.
``
i
've
had
a
plain-clothes
man
waiting
at
the
station
all
the
week
.
wherever
the
high
gable
folk
go
he
will
keep
them
in
sight

but
he
must
have
been
hard
put
to
it
when
miss
burnet
broke
away
.
however
,
your
man
picked
her
up
,
and
it
all
ends
well
.
we
ca
n't
arrest
without
her
evidence

is
clear

``
every

she
gets
stronger

''
said
holmes
,
glancing
at
the
governess
.
``
but
tell
me
,
baynes
,
who
is
this
man
henderson
?
''
``
henderson
,
''
the
inspector
answered
,
``
is
don
murillo
,
once
called
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
.
''
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
!
the
whole
history
of
the
man
came
back
to
me
in
a
flash
.
he
had
made
his
name
as
the
most
lewd
and
bloodthirsty
tyrant
that
had
ever
governed
any
country
with
a
pretence
to
civilization
.
strong
,
fearless
,
and
energetic
,
he
had
sufficient
virtue
to
enable
him
to
impose
his
odious
vices
upon
a
cowering
people
for
ten
or
twelve
years
.
his
name
was
a
terror
through
all
central
america
.
at
the
end
of
that
time
there
was
a
universal
rising
against
him
.
but
he
was
as
cunning
as
he
was
cruel
,
and
at
the
first
whisper
of
coming
trouble
he
had
secretly
conveyed
his
treasures
aboard
a
ship
which
was
manned
by
devoted
adherents
.
it
was
an
empty
palace
which
was
stormed
by
the
insurgents
next
day
.
the
dictator
,
his
two
children
,
his
secretary
,
and
his
wealth
had
all
escaped
them
.
from
that
moment
he
had
vanished
from
the
world
,
and
his
identity
had
been
a
frequent
subject
for
comment
in
the
european
press
.
``
yes
,
sir
,
don
murillo
,
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
,
''
said
baynes
.
``
if
you
look
it
up
you
will
find
that
the
san
pedro
colours
are
green
and
white
,
same
as
in
the
note
,
mr.
holmes
.
henderson
he
called
himself
,
but
i
traced
him
back
,
paris
and
rome
and
madrid
to
barcelona
,
where
his
ship
came
in
in
'86
.
they
've
been
looking
for
him
all
the
time
for
their
revenge
,
but
it
is
only
now
that
they
have
begun
to
find
him
out
.
''
``
they
discovered
him
a
year
ago
,
''
said
miss
burnet
,
who
had
sat
up
and
was
now
intently
following
the
conversation
.
``
once
already
his
life
has
been
attempted
,
but
some
evil
spirit
shielded
him
.
now
,
again
,
it
is
the
noble
,
chivalrous
garcia
who
has
fallen
,
while
the
monster
goes
safe
.
but
another
will
come
,
and
yet
another
,
until
some
day
justice
will
be
done
;
that
is
as
certain
as
the
rise
of
to-morrow
's
sun
.
''
her
thin
hands
clenched
,
and
her
worn
face
blanched
with
the
passion
of
her
hatred
.
``
but
how
come
you
into
this
matter
,
miss
burnet
?
''
asked
holmes
.
``
how
can
an
english
lady
join
in
such
a
murderous
affair
?
''
``
i
join
in
it
because
there
is
no
other
way
in
the
world
by
which
justice
can
be
gained
.
what
does
the
law
of
england
care
for
the
rivers
of
blood
shed
years
ago
in
san
pedro
,
or
for
the
shipload
of
treasure
which
this
man
has
stolen
?
to
you
they
are
like
crimes
committed
in
some
other
planet
.
but
we
know
.
we
have
learned
the
truth
in
sorrow
and
in
suffering
.
to
us
there
is
no
fiend
in
hell
like
juan
murillo

no

``
no

,
''
said
holmes
,
``
he
was
as
you
say
.
i
have
heard
that
he
was
atrocious
.
but
how
are
you
affected
?
''
``
i
will
tell
you
it
all
.
this
villain
's
policy
was
to
murder
,
on
one
pretext
or
another
,
every
man
who
showed
such
promise
that
he
might
in
time
come
to
be
a
dangerous
rival
.
my
husband
--
yes
,
my
real
name
is
signora
victor
durando
--
was
the
san
pedro
minister
in
london
.
he
met
me
and
married
me
there
.
a
nobler
man
never
lived
upon
earth
.
unhappily
,
murillo
heard
of
his
excellence
,
recalled
him
on
some
pretext
,
and
had
him
shot
.
with
a
premonition
of
his
fate
he
had
refused
to
take
me
with
him
.
his
estates
were
confiscated
,
and
i
was
left
with
a
pittance
and
a
broken
heart
.
``
then
came
the
downfall
of
the
tyrant
.
he
escaped
as
you
have
just
described
.
but
the
many
whose
lives
he
had
ruined
,
whose
nearest
and
dearest
had
suffered
torture
and
death
at
his
hands
,
would
not
let
the
matter
rest
.
they
banded
themselves
into
a
society
which
should
never
be
dissolved
until
the
work
was
done
.
it
was
my
part
after
we
had
discovered
in
the
transformed
henderson
the
fallen
despot
,
to
attach
myself
to
his
household
and
keep
the
others
in
touch
with
his
movements
.
this
i
was
able
to
do
by
securing
the
position
of
governess
in
his
family
.
he
little
knew
that
the
woman
who
faced
him
at
every
meal
was
the
woman
whose
husband
he
had
hurried
at
an
hour
's
notice
into
eternity
.
i
smiled
on
him
,
did
my
duty
to
his
children
,
and
bided
my
time
.
an
attempt
was
made
in
paris
and
failed
.
we
zig-zagged
swiftly
here
and
there
over
europe
to
throw
off
the
pursuers
and
finally
returned
to
this
house
,
which
he
had
taken
upon
his
first
arrival
in
england
.
``
but
here
also
the
ministers
of
justice
were
waiting
.
knowing
that
he
would
return
there
,
garcia
,
who
is
the
son
of
the
former
highest
dignitary
in
san
pedro
,
was
waiting
with
two
trusty
companions
of
humble
station
,
all
three
fired
with
the
same
reasons
for
revenge
.
he
could
do
little
during
the
day
,
for
murillo
took
every
precaution
and
never
went
out
save
with
his
satellite
lucas
,
or
lopez
as
he
was
known
in
the
days
of
his
greatness
.
at
night
,
however
,
he
slept
alone
,
and
the
avenger
might
find
him
.
on
a
certain
evening
,
which
had
been
prearranged
,
i
sent
my
friend
final
instructions
,
for
the
man
was
forever
on
the
alert
and
continually
changed
his
room
.
i
was
to
see
that
the
doors
were
open
and
the
signal
of
a
green
or
white
light
in
a
window
which
faced
the
drive
was
to
give
notice
if
all
was
safe
or
if
the
attempt
had
better
be
postponed
.
``
but
everything
went
wrong
with
us
.
in
some
way
i
had
excited
the
suspicion
of
lopez
,
the
secretary
.
he
crept
up
behind
me
and
sprang
upon
me
just
as
i
had
finished
the
note
.
he
and
his
master
dragged
me
to
my
room
and
held
judgment
upon
me
as
a
convicted
traitress
.
then
and
there
they
would
have
plunged
their
knives
into
me
could
they
have
seen
how
to
escape
the
consequences
of
the
deed
.
finally
,
after
much
debate
,
they
concluded
that
my
murder
was
too
dangerous
.
but
they
determined
to
get
rid
forever
of
garcia
.
they
had
gagged
me
,
and
murillo
twisted
my
arm
round
until
i
gave
him
the
address
.
i
swear
that
he
might
have
twisted
it
off
had
i
understood
what
it
would
mean
to
garcia
.
lopez
addressed
the
note
which
i
had
written
,
sealed
it
with
his
sleeve-link
,
and
sent
it
by
the
hand
of
the
servant
,
jose
.
how
they
murdered
him
i
do
not
know
,
save
that
it
was
murillo
's
hand
who
struck
him
down
,
for
lopez
had
remained
to
guard
me
.
i
believe
he
must
have
waited
among
the
gorse
bushes
through
which
the
path
winds
and
struck
him
down
as
he
passed
.
at
first
they
were
of
a
mind
to
let
him
enter
the
house
and
to
kill
him
as
a
detected
burglar
;
but
they
argued
that
if
they
were
mixed
up
in
an
inquiry
their
own
identity
would
at
once
be
publicly
disclosed
and
they
would
be
open
to
further
attacks
.
with
the
death
of
garcia
,
the
pursuit
might
cease
,
since
such
a
death
might
frighten
others
from
the
task
.
``
all
would
now
have
been
well
for
them
had
it
not
been
for
my
knowledge
of
what
they
had
done
.
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
were
times
when
my
life
hung
in
the
balance
.
i
was
confined
to
my
room
,
terrorized
by
the
most
horrible
threats
,
cruelly
ill-used
to
break
my
spirit
--
see
this
stab
on
my
shoulder
and
the
bruises
from
end
to
end
of
my
arms
--
and
a
gag
was
thrust
into
my
mouth
on
the
one
occasion
when
i
tried
to
call
from
the
window
.
for
five
days
this
cruel
imprisonment
continued
,
with
hardly
enough
food
to
hold
body
and
soul
together
.
this
afternoon
a
good
lunch
was
brought
me
,
but
the
moment
after
i
took
it
i
knew
that
i
had
been
drugged
.
in
a
sort
of
dream
i
remember
being
half-led
,
half-carried
to
the
carriage
;
in
the
same
state
i
was
conveyed
to
the
train
.
only
then
,
when
the
wheels
were
almost
moving
,
did
i
suddenly
realize
that
my
liberty
lay
in
my
own
hands
.
i
sprang
out
,
they
tried
to
drag
me
back
,
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
help
of
this
good
man
,
who
led
me
to
the
cab
,
i
should
never
had
broken
away
.
i
sprang
out

back

that
a

time
was
still
to
elapse
before
the
tiger
of
san
pedro
should
meet
with
his
deserts

wily
and
bold
,
he
and
his
companion
threw
their
pursuer
off
their
track
by
entering
a
lodging-house
in
edmonton
street
and
leaving
by
the
back-gate
into
curzon
square
.
from
that
day
they
were
seen
no
more
in
england
.
some
six
months
afterwards
the
marquess
of
montalva
and
signor
rulli
,
his
secretary
,
were
both
murdered
in
their
rooms
at
the
hotel
escurial
at
madrid
.
the
crime
was
ascribed
to
nihilism
,
and
the
murderers
were
never
arrested
.
inspector
baynes
visited
us
at
baker
street
with
a
printed
description
of
the
dark
face
of
the
secretary
,
and
of
the
masterful
features

the
magnetic
black
eyes

tufted
brows

could
not

``

said
holmes
over
an
evening
pipe
.
``

further
complicated
by
the
highly
respectable
presence

me
that
the

a

kept

''
``
i
think
that
the
strange
creature
in
the
kitchen
may
account
for
it
.
the
man
was
a
primitive
savage
from
the
backwoods
of
san
pedro
,
and
this
was
his
fetish
.
when
his
companion
and
he
had
fled
to
some
prearranged
retreat
--
already
occupied
,
no
doubt
by
a
confederate
--
the
companion
had
persuaded
him
to
leave
so
compromising
an
article
of
furniture
.
but
the
mulatto
's
heart
was
with
it
,
and
he
was
driven
back
to
it
next
day
,
when
,
on
reconnoitering
through
the
window
,
he
found
policeman
walters
in
possession
.
he
waited
three
days
longer
,
and
then
his
piety
or
his
superstition
drove
him
to
try
once
more

inspector
baynes
,
who
,
with
his
usual
astuteness
,
had
minimized
the
incident
before
me

really
recognized
its
importance

had
left

holmes
smiled
as
he
turned
up
an
entry
in
his
note-book
.
``
i
spent
a
morning
in
the
british
museum
reading
up
on
that
and
other
points

here
is
a
quotation
from
eckermann
's
voodooism
and
the
negroid
religions
:
``

cases
these

take
the
form
of

by

the
more
usual
victims
are
a
white

with
this
short
preface
i
shall
turn
to
my
notes
of
what
proved
to
be
a
strange
,
though
a
peculiarly
terrible
,
chain
of
events
.
it
was
a
blazing
hot
day
in
august
.
baker
street
was
like
an
oven
,
and
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
upon
the
yellow
brickwork
of
the
house
across
the
road
was
painful
to
the
eye
.
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
these
were
the
same
walls
which
loomed
so
gloomily
through
the
fogs
of
winter
.
our
blinds
were
half-drawn
,
and
holmes
lay
curled
upon
the
sofa
,
reading
and
re-reading
a
letter
which
he
had
received
by
the
morning
post
.
for
myself
,
my
term
of
service
in
india
had
trained
me
to
stand
heat
better
than
cold
,
and
a
thermometer
at
ninety
was
no
hardship
.
but
the
morning
paper
was
uninteresting
.
parliament
had
risen
.
everybody
was
out
of
town
,
and
i
yearned
for
the
glades
of
the
new
forest
or
the
shingle
of
southsea
.
a
depleted
bank
account
had
caused
me
to
postpone
my
holiday
,
and
as
to
my
companion
,
neither
the
country
nor
the
sea
presented
the
slightest
attraction
to
him
.
he
loved
to
lie
in
the
very
center
of
five
millions
of
people
,
with
his
filaments
stretching
out
and
running
through
them
,
responsive
to
every
little
rumour
or
suspicion
of
unsolved
crime
.
appreciation
of
nature
found
no
place
among
his
many
gifts
,
and
his
only
change
was
when
he
turned
his
mind
from
the
evil-doer
of
the
town
to
track
down
his
brother
of
the
country
.
finding
that
holmes
was
too
absorbed
for
conversation
i
had
tossed
aside
the
barren
paper
,
and
leaning
back
in
my
chair
i
fell
into
a
brown
study
.
suddenly
my
companion
's
voice
broke
in
upon
my
thoughts
:
``
you
are
right
,
watson
,
''
said
he
.
``
it
does
seem
a
most
preposterous
way
of
settling
a
dispute
.
''
``
most
preposterous
!
''
i
exclaimed
,
and
then
suddenly
realizing
how
he
had
echoed
the
inmost
thought
of
my
soul
,
i
sat
up
in
my
chair
and
stared
at
him
in
blank
amazement
.
``
what
is
this
,
holmes
?
''
i
cried
.
``
this
is
beyond
anything
which
i
could
have
imagined
.
''
he
laughed
heartily
at
my
perplexity
.
``
you
remember
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
some
little
time
ago
when
i
read
you
the
passage
in
one
of
poe
's
sketches
in
which
a
close
reasoner
follows
the
unspoken
thoughts
of
his
companion
,
you
were
inclined
to
treat
the
matter
as
a
mere
tour-de-force
of
the
author
.
on
my
remarking
that
i
was
constantly
in
the
habit
of
doing
the
same
thing
you
expressed
incredulity
.
''
``
oh
,
no
!
''
``
perhaps
not
with
your
tongue
,
my
dear
watson
,
but
certainly
with
your
eyebrows
.
so
when
i
saw
you
throw
down
your
paper
and
enter
upon
a
train
of
thought
,
i
was
very
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
of
reading
it
off
,
and
eventually
of
breaking
into
it
,
as
a
proof
that
i
had
been
in
rapport
with
you
.
''
but
i
was
still
far
from
satisfied
.
``
in
the
example
which
you
read
to
me
,
''
said
i
,
``
the
reasoner
drew
his
conclusions
from
the
actions
of
the
man
whom
he
observed
.
if
i
remember
right
,
he
stumbled
over
a
heap
of
stones
,
looked
up
at
the
stars
,
and
so
on
.
but
i
have
been
seated
quietly
in
my
chair
,
and
what
clues
can
i
have
given
you
?
''
``
you
do
yourself
an
injustice
.
the
features
are
given
to
man
as
the
means
by
which
he
shall
express
his
emotions
,
and
yours
are
faithful
servants
.
''
``
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
read
my
train
of
thoughts
from
my
features
?
''
``
your
features
and
especially
your
eyes
.
perhaps
you
can
not
yourself
recall
how
your
reverie
commenced
?
''
``
no
,
i
can
not
.
''
``
no
,
i
can
not
.
''
``
then
i
will
tell
you
.
after
throwing
down
your
paper
,
which
was
the
action
which
drew
my
attention
to
you
,
you
sat
for
half
a
minute
with
a
vacant
expression
.
then
your
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
your
newly
framed
picture
of
general
gordon
,
and
i
saw
by
the
alteration
in
your
face
that
a
train
of
thought
had
been
started
.
but
it
did
not
lead
very
far
.
your
eyes
flashed
across
to
the
unframed
portrait
of
henry
ward
beecher
which
stands
upon
the
top
of
your
books
.
then
you
glanced
up
at
the
wall
,
and
of
course
your
meaning
was
obvious
.
you
were
thinking
that
if
the
portrait
were
framed
it
would
just
cover
that
bare
space
and
correspond
with
gordon
's
picture
there
.
''
``
you
have
followed
me
wonderfully
!
''
i
exclaimed
.
``
so
far
i
could
hardly
have
gone
astray
.
but
now
your
thoughts
went
back
to
beecher
,
and
you
looked
hard
across
as
if
you
were
studying
the
character
in
his
features
.
then
your
eyes
ceased
to
pucker
,
but
you
continued
to
look
across
,
and
your
face
was
thoughtful
.
you
were
recalling
the
incidents
of
beecher
's
career
.
i
was
well
aware
that
you
could
not
do
this
without
thinking
of
the
mission
which
he
undertook
on
behalf
of
the
north
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war
,
for
i
remember
your
expressing
your
passionate
indignation
at
the
way
in
which
he
was
received
by
the
more
turbulent
of
our
people
.

when
a
moment
later
i
saw
your
eyes
wander
away
from
the
picture
,
i
suspected
that
your
mind
had
now
turned
to
the
civil
war
,
and
when
i
observed
that
your
lips
set
,
your
eyes
sparkled
,
and
your
hands
clenched
i
was
positive
that
you
were
indeed
thinking
of
the
gallantry
which
was
shown
by
both
sides
in
that
desperate
struggle
.
but
then
,
again
,
your
face
grew
sadder
,
you
shook
your
head
.
you
were
dwelling
upon
the
sadness
and
horror
and
useless
waste
of
life
.
your
hand
stole
towards
your
own
old
wound
and
a
smile
quivered
on
your
lips
,
which
showed
me
that
the
ridiculous
side
of
this
method
of
settling
international
questions
had
forced
itself
upon
your
mind
.
at
this
point
i
agreed
with
you
that
it
was
preposterous
and
was
glad
to
find
that
all
my
deductions
had
been
correct
.
''
``
absolutely
!
''
said
i
.
``
and
now
that
you
have
explained
it
,
i
confess
that
i
am
as
amazed
as
before

it
was

superficial

here
a
little
problem
which
may
prove
to
be
more
difficult
of
solution
than
my
small
essay
in
thought
reading
.
have
you
observed
in
the
paper
a
short
paragraph
referring
to
the
remarkable
contents
of
a
packet
sent
through
the
post

you
must

overlooked

over
to

here
it
is
,
under
the
financial
column

perhaps
you
would
be
good
enough
to
read
it
aloud

''
i
picked
up
the
paper
which
he
had
thrown
back
to
me
and
read
the
paragraph
indicated
.
it
was
headed
,
``

gruesome
packet

``

regarded
as
a
peculiarly
revolting
practical
joke
unless
some
more
sinister
meaning
should
prove
to
be
attached
to
the
incident

at
two
o'clock
yesterday
afternoon
a
small
packet
,
wrapped
in
brown
paper
,
was
handed
in
by
the
postman

a
cardboard
box
was
inside
,
which
was
filled
with
coarse
salt
.
on
emptying
this
,
miss
cushing
was
horrified
to
find
two
human
ears
,
apparently
quite
freshly
severed
.
the
box
had
been
sent
by
parcel
post
from
belfast
upon
the
morning
before
.
there
is
no
indication
as
to
the
sender
,
and
the
matter
is
the
more
mysterious
as
miss
cushing
,
who
is
a
maiden
lady
of
fifty
,
has
led
a
most
retired
life
,
and
has
so
few
acquaintances
or
correspondents
that
it
is
a
rare
event
for
her
to
receive
anything
through
the
post

some
years
ago
,
however
,
when
she
resided
at
penge
,
she
let
apartments
in
her
house
to
three
young
medical
students
,
whom
she
was
obliged
to
get
rid
of
on
account
of
their
noisy
and
irregular
habits
.
the
police
are
of
opinion
that
this
outrage
may
have
been
perpetrated
upon
miss
cushing
by
these
youths
,
who
owed
her
a
grudge
and
who
hoped
to
frighten
her
by
sending
her
these
relics
of
the
dissecting-rooms
.
some
probability
is
lent
to
the
theory
by
the
fact
that
one
of
these
students
came
from
the
north
of
ireland
,
and
,
to
the
best
of
miss
cushing
's
belief
,
from
belfast
.
in
the
meantime
,
the
matter
is
being
actively
investigated
,
mr.
lestrade
,
one
of
the
very
smartest
of
our
detective
officers
,
being
in
charge
of
the
case
.
''
``
so
much
for
the
daily
chronicle
,
''
said
holmes
as
i
finished
reading
.
``
now
for
our
friend
lestrade
.
i
had
a
note
from
him
this
morning
,
in
which
he
says
:
``
i
think
that
this
case
is
very
much
in
your
line
.
we
have
every
hope
of
clearing
the
matter
up
,
but
we
find
a
little
difficulty
in
getting
anything
to
work
upon
.
we
have
,
of
course
,
wired
to
the
belfast
post-office
,
but
a
large
number
of
parcels
were
handed
in
upon
that
day
,
and
they
have
no
means
of
identifying
this
particular
one
,
or
of
remembering
the
sender
.
the
box
is
a
half-pound
box
of
honeydew
tobacco
and
does
not
help
us
in
any
way
.
the
medical
student
theory
still
appears
to
me
to
be
the
most
feasible
,
but
if
you
should
have
a
few
hours
to
spare
i
should
be
very
happy
to
see
you
out
here
.
i
shall
be
either
at
the
house
or
in
the
police-station
all
day
.
``
what
say
you
,
watson
?
can
you
rise
superior
to
the
heat
and
run
down
to
croydon
with
me
on
the
off
chance
of
a
case
for
your
annals
?
''
``
i
was
longing
for
something
to
do
.
''
``
you
shall
have
it
then
.
ring
for
our
boots
and
tell
them
to
order
a
cab
.
i
'll
be
back
in
a
moment
when
i
have
changed
my
dressing-gown
and
filled
my
cigar-case
.
''
a
shower
of
rain
fell
while
we
were
in
the
train
,
and
the
heat
was
far
less
oppressive
in
croydon
than
in
town
.
holmes
had
sent
on
a
wire
,
so
that
lestrade
,
as
wiry
,
as
dapper
,
and
as
ferret-like
as
ever
,
was
waiting
for
us
at
the
station
.
a
walk
of
five
minutes
took
us
to
cross
street
,
where
miss
cushing
resided
.
it
was
a
very
long
street
of
two-story
brick
houses
,
neat
and
prim
,
with
whitened
stone
steps
and
little
groups
of
aproned
women
gossiping
at
the
doors
.
halfway
down
,
lestrade
stopped
and
tapped
at
a
door
,
which
was
opened
by
a
small
servant
girl
.
miss
cushing
was
sitting
in
the
front
room
,
into
which
we
were
ushered
.
she
was
a
placid-faced
woman
,
with
large
,
gentle
eyes
,
and
grizzled
hair
curving
down
over
her
temples
on
each
side
.
a
worked
antimacassar
lay
upon
her
lap
and
a
basket
of
coloured
silks
stood
upon
a
stool
beside
her
.
``
they
are
in
the
outhouse
,
those
dreadful
things
,
''
said
she
as
lestrade
entered
.
``
i
wish
that
you
would
take
them
away
altogether
.
''
``
so
i
shall
,
miss
cushing
.
i
only
kept
them
here
until
my
friend
,
mr.
holmes
,
should
have
seen
them
in
your
presence
.
''
``
why
in
my
presence
,
sir
?
''
``
in
case
he
wished
to
ask
any
questions
.
''
``
what
is
the
use
of
asking
me
questions
when
i
tell
you
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
?
''
``
quite
so
,
madam
,
''
said
holmes
in
his
soothing
way
.
``
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
have
been
annoyed
more
than
enough
already
over
this
business
.
''
``
indeed
i
have
,
sir
.
i
am
a
quiet
woman
and
live
a
retired
life
.
it
is
something
new
for
me
to
see
my
name
in
the
papers
and
to
find
the
police
in
my
house
.
i
wo
n't
have
those
things
in
here
,
mr.
lestrade
.
if
you
wish
to
see
them
you
must
go
to
the
outhouse
.
''
it
was
a
small
shed
in
the
narrow
garden
which
ran
behind
the
house
.
lestrade
went
in
and
brought
out
a
yellow
cardboard
box
,
with
a
piece
of
brown
paper
and
some
string
.
there
was
a
bench
at
the
end
of
the
path
,
and
we
all
sat
down
while
homes
examined
one
by
one
,
the
articles
which
lestrade
had
handed
to
him
.
``
the
string
is
exceedingly
interesting
,
''
he
remarked
,
holding
it
up
to
the
light
and
sniffing
at
it
.
``
what
do
you
make
of
this
string
,
lestrade
?
''
``
it
has
been
tarred
.
''
``
precisely
.
it
is
a
piece
of
tarred
twine
.
you
have
also
,
no
doubt
,
remarked
that
miss
cushing
has
cut
the
cord
with
a
scissors
,
as
can
be
seen
by
the
double
fray
on
each
side
.
this
is
of
importance
.
''
``
i
can
not
see
the
importance
,
''
said
lestrade
.
``
the
importance
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
knot
is
left
intact
,
and
that
this
knot
is
of
a
peculiar
character
.
''
``
it
is
very
neatly
tied
.
i
had
already
made
a
note
of
that
effect
,
''
said
lestrade
complacently
.
``
so
much
for
the
string
,
then
,
''
said
holmes
,
smiling
,
``
now
for
the
box
wrapper
.
brown
paper
,
with
a
distinct
smell
of
coffee

you
not
observe
it

there
can
be
no
doubt

address
printed
in
rather
straggling
characters
:

done
with
a
broad-pointed
pen
,
probably
a

and
with
very
inferior
ink
.
the
word
`
croydon
'
has
been
originally
spelled
with
an
`
i
'
,
which
has
been
changed
to
`
y
'
.
the
parcel
was
directed
,
then
,
by
a
man
--
the
printing
is
distinctly
masculine
--
of
limited
education
and
unacquainted
with
the
town
of
croydon
.
so
far
,
so
good
!
the
box
is
a
yellow
,
half-pound
honeydew
box
,
with
nothing
distinctive
save
two
thumb
marks
at
the
left
bottom
corner
.
it
is
filled
with
rough
salt
of
the
quality
used
for
preserving
hides
and
other
of
the
coarser
commercial
purposes
.
and
embedded
in
it
are
these
very
singular
enclosures
.
''
he
took
out
the
two
ears
as
he
spoke
,
and
laying
a
board
across
his
knee
he
examined
them
minutely
,
while
lestrade
and
i
,
bending
forward
on
each
side
of
him
,
glanced
alternately
at
these
dreadful
relics
and
at
the
thoughtful
,
eager
face
of
our
companion
.
finally
he
returned
them
to
the
box
once
more
and
sat
for
a
while
in
deep
meditation
.
``
you
have
observed
,
of
course
,
''
said
he
at
last
,
``
that
the
ears
are
not
a
pair
.
''
``
yes
,
i
have
noticed
that
.
but
if
this
were
the
practical
joke
of
some
students
from
the
dissecting-rooms
,
it
would
be
as
easy
for
them
to
send
two
odd
ears
as
a
pair
.
''
``
precisely
.
but
this
is
not
a
practical
joke
.
''
``
you
are
sure
of
it
?
''
``
the
presumption
is
strongly
against
it
.
bodies
in
the
dissecting-rooms
are
injected
with
preservative
fluid
.
these
ears
bear
no
signs
of
this
.
they
are
fresh
,
too
.
they
have
been
cut
off
with
a
blunt
instrument
,
which
would
hardly
happen
if
a
student
had
done
it
.
again
,
carbolic
or
rectified
spirits
would
be
the
preservatives
which
would
suggest
themselves
to
the
medical
mind
,
certainly
not
rough
salt
.
i
repeat
that
there
is
no
practical
joke
here
,
but
that
we
are
investigating
a
serious
crime
.
''
a
vague
thrill
ran
through
me
as
i
listened
to
my
companion
's
words
and
saw
the
stern
gravity
which
had
hardened
his
features
.
this
brutal
preliminary
seemed
to
shadow
forth
some
strange
and
inexplicable
horror
in
the
background
.
lestrade
,
however
,
shook
his
head
like
a
man
who
is
only
half
convinced
.
``
there
are
objections
to
the
joke
theory
,
no
doubt
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
there
are
much
stronger
reasons
against
the
other
.
we
know
that
this
woman
has
led
a
most
quiet
and
respectable
life
at
penge
and
here
for
the
last
twenty
years
.
she
has
hardly
been
away
from
her
home
for
a
day
during
that
time
.
why
on
earth
,
then
,
should
any
criminal
send
her
the
proofs
of
his
guilt
,
especially
as
,
unless
she
is
a
most
consummate
actress
,
she
understands
quite
as
little
of
the
matter
as
we
do
?
''
``
that
is
the
problem
which
we
have
to
solve
,
''
holmes
answered
,
``
and
for
my
part
i
shall
set
about
it
by
presuming
that
my
reasoning
is
correct
,
and
that
a
double
murder
has
been
committed
.
one
of
these
ears
is
a
woman
's
,
small
,
finely
formed
,
and
pierced
for
an
earring
.
the
other
is
a
man
's
,
sun-burned
,
discoloured
,
and
also
pierced
for
an
earring
.
these
two
people
are
presumably
dead
,
or
we
should
have
heard
their
story
before
now
.
to-day
is
friday
.
the
packet
was
posted
on
thursday
morning
.
the
tragedy
,
then
,
occurred
on
wednesday
or
tuesday
,
or
earlier
.
if
the
two
people
were
murdered
,
who
but
their
murderer
would
have
sent
this
sign
of
his
work
to
miss
cushing
?
we
may
take
it
that
the
sender
of
the
packet
is
the
man
whom
we
want
.
but
he
must
have
some
strong
reason
for
sending
miss
cushing
this
packet
.
what
reason
then
?
it
must
have
been
to
tell
her
that
the
deed
was
done
!
or
to
pain
her
,
perhaps
.
but
in
that
case
she
knows
who
it
is
.
does
she
know
?
i
doubt
it
.
if
she
knew
,
why
should
she
call
the
police
in
?
she
might
have
buried
the
ears
,
and
no
one
would
have
been
the
wiser
.
that
is
what
she
would
have
done
if
she
had
wished
to
shield
the
criminal
.
but
if
she
does
not
wish
to
shield
him
she
would
give
his
name
.
there
is
a
tangle
here
which
needs
straightening
out
.
''
he
had
been
talking
in
a
high
,
quick
voice
,
staring
blankly
up
over
the
garden
fence
,
but
now
he
sprang
briskly
to
his
feet
and
walked
towards
the
house
.
``
i
have
a
few
questions
to
ask
miss
cushing
,
''
said
he
.
``
in
that
case
i
may
leave
you
here
,
''
said
lestrade
,
``
for
i
have
another
small
business
on
hand
.
i
think
that
i
have
nothing
further
to
learn
from

cushing
.
you
will
find
me
at
the
police-station

''
``
we
shall
look
in
on
our
way
to
the
train

''
answered
holmes
.
a
moment
later
he
and
i
were
back
in
the
front
room
,
where
the
impassive
lady
was
still
quietly
working
away
at
her
antimacassar
.
she
put
it
down
on
her
lap
as
we
entered
and
looked
at
us
with
her
frank
,
searching
blue
eyes
.
``
i
am
convinced
,
sir
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
this
matter
is
a
mistake
,
and
that
the
parcel
was
never
meant
for
me
at
all
.
i
have
said
this
several
times
to
the
gentlemen
from
scotland
yard
,
but
he
simply
laughs
at
me
.
i
have
not
an
enemy
in
the
world
,
as
far
as
i
know
,
so
why
should
anyone
play
me
such
a
trick
?

``
i
am
coming
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
miss
cushing
,
''
said
holmes
,
taking
a
seat
beside
her
.
``
i
think
that
it
is
more
than
probable
--
''
he
paused
,
and
i
was
surprised
,
on
glancing
round
to
see
that
he
was
staring
with
singular
intentness
at
the
lady
's
profile
.
surprise
and
satisfaction
were
both
for
an
instant
to
be
read
upon
his
eager
face
,
though
when
she
glanced
round
to
find
out
the
cause
of
his
silence
he
had
become
as
demure
as
ever
.
i
stared
hard
myself
at
her
flat
,
grizzled
hair
,
her
trim
cap
,
her
little
gilt
earrings
,
her
placid
features
;
but
i
could
see
nothing
which
could
account
for
my
companion
's
evident
excitement
.
``
there
were
one
or
two
questions
--
''
``
oh
,
i
am
weary
of
questions
!
''
cried
miss
cushing
impatiently
.
``
you
have
two
sisters
,
i
believe
.
''
``
how
could
you
know
that
?
''
``
i
observed
the
very
instant
that
i
entered
the
room
that
you
have
a
portrait
group
of
three
ladies
upon
the
mantelpiece
,
one
of
whom
is
undoubtedly
yourself
,
while
the
others
are
so
exceedingly
like
you
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
relationship
.
''
``
yes
,
you
are
quite
right

those
are
my
sisters
,
sarah

mary

''
``
and
here
at
my
elbow
is
another
portrait
,
taken
at
liverpool
,
of
your
younger
sister
,
in
the
company
of
a
man
who
appears
to
be
a
steward
by
his
uniform
.
i
observe
that
she
was
unmarried
at
the
time

``
you
are
very
quick
at
observing
.
''
``
that
is
my
trade
.
''
``
well
,
you
are
quite
right

but
she
was
married
to
mr.
browner
a
few
days
afterwards
.
he
was
on
the
south
american
line
when
that
was
taken
,
but
he
was
so
fond
of
her
that
he
could
n't
abide
to
leave
her
for
so
long
,

he
got
into
the
liverpool

london
boats

``
ah

the
conqueror

perhaps
?
''
``
no

the
may
day

i
heard

came
down
here
to
see
me
once

that
was
before
he
broke
the
pledge

afterwards
he
would
always
take
drink
when
he
was
ashore
,
and
a
little
drink
would
send
him
stark
,
staring
mad

ah
!
it
was
a
bad
day
that
ever
he
took
a
glass
in
his
hand
again

first
he
dropped
me

then
he
quarrelled
with

now
that
mary
has
stopped
writing
we
do
n't
know
how
things
are
going
with

''
it
was
evident
that
miss
cushing
had
come
upon
a
subject
on
which
she
felt
very
deeply
.
like
most
people
who
lead
a
lonely
life
,
she
was
shy
at
first
,
but
ended
by
becoming
extremely
communicative
.
she
told
us
many
details
about
her
brother-in-law
the
steward
,
and
then
wandering
off
on
the
subject
of
her
former

gave
us
a
long
account
of
their
delinquencies
,
with
their
names
and
those
of
their
hospitals

holmes
listened
attentively
to
everything
,
throwing
in
a
question
from
time
to
time
.
``
about
your
second
sister
,
sarah
,
''
said
he
.
``
i
wonder
,
since
you
are
both
maiden
ladies
,
that
you
do
not
keep
house
together
.
''
``
ah
!
you
do
n't
know
sarah
's
temper
or
you
would
wonder
no
more
.
``

i
tried
it
when
i
came
to
croydon
,
and
we
kept
on
until
about
two
months
ago
,
when
we
had
to
part
.
i
do
n't
want
to
say
a
word
against
my
own
sister
,
but
she
was
always
meddlesome
and
hard
to
please

sarah
.
''
``
you
say
that
she
quarrelled
with
your
liverpool
relations
.
''
``
yes
,
and
they
were
the
best
of
friends
at
one
time

she
went
up
there
to
live
in
order
to
be
near
them

and
now
she
has
no
word
hard
enough
for
jim
browner
.
the
last
six
months
that
she
was
here
she
would
speak
of
nothing
but
his
drinking
and
his
ways
.
he
had
caught
her
meddling
,
i
suspect
,
and
given
her
a
bit
of
his
mind
,
and
that
was
the
start
of
it
.

``

you

holmes
,
rising
and
bowing

was

holmes
sent
off
a
short

for
the
rest
of
the
drive
lay
back
in
the

,
with
his
hat
tilted
over
his
nose
to
keep
the
sun
from

to
wait

had
his
hand
upon

knocker
,
when
the
door
opened
and
a
grave
young
gentleman
in
black
,
with
a
very
shiny

,
appeared
on
the
step
.

drew
on

off
down

''
we
had
a
pleasant
little
meal
together
,
during
which
holmes
would
talk
about
nothing
but
violins
,
narrating
with
great
exultation
how
he
had
purchased
his
own
stradivarius
,
which
was
worth
at
least
five
hundred
guineas
,
at
a
jew
broker
's
in
tottenham
court
road
for
fifty-five
shillings
.
this
led
him
to
paganini
,
and
we
sat
for
an
hour
over
a
bottle
of
claret
while
he
told
me
anecdote
after
anecdote
of
that
extraordinary
man
.
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
and
the
hot
glare
had
softened
into
a
mellow
glow
before
we
found
ourselves
at

lestrade
was
waiting
for
us
at
the
door
.
``

said
he
.
``

!
it
is

he
tore
it
open
,
glanced
his
eyes
over
it
,
and
crumpled
it
into
his
pocket
.
``

's
all

said
he
.

``

stared
at
him
in
amazement

``

``

holmes
scribbled
a
few
words
upon

of

threw
it
over
to

''
we
strode
off
together
to
the
station
,
leaving
lestrade
still
staring
with
a
delighted
face
at
the
card
which
holmes
had
thrown
him
.
``
the
case
,
''
said
sherlock
holmes
as
we
chatted
over
our
cigars
that
night
in
our
rooms
at
baker
street
,
``
is
one
where
,
as
in
the
investigations
which
you
have
chronicled
under
the
names
of
`
a
study

'
and
of
`
the
sign
of

,
'
we
have
been
compelled
to
reason
backward
from
effects
to
causes

i
have
written
to

him
to
supply
us
with
the
details

are
now
wanting

he
will
only
get

that
he
may
be
safely
trusted
to
do
,
for
although
he
is
absolutely
devoid
of
reason
,
he
is
as
tenacious
as
a
bulldog
when
he
once
understands
what
he
has
to
do
,
and
indeed
,
it
is
just
this
tenacity
which
has
brought
him
to
the
top
at
scotland
yard

''
``
your
case
is
not
complete
,
then
?
''
i
asked
.
``
it
is
fairly
complete
in
essentials
.

know
who
the
author
of
the
revolting
business
is
,
although
one
of
the
victims
still
escapes
us
.
of
course
,
you
have
formed
your
own
conclusions
.
''
``
i
presume
that
this
jim
browner
,
the
steward
of
a
liverpool
boat
,
is
the
man
whom
you
suspect
?
''
``
oh
!
it
is
more
than
a
suspicion
.
''
``
and
yet
i
can
not
see
anything
save
very
vague
indications
.
''
``
on
the
contrary
,
to
my
mind
nothing
could
be
more
clear
.
let
me
run
over
the
principal
steps
.
we
approached
the
case
,
you
remember
,
with
an
absolutely
blank
mind
,
which
is
always
an
advantage
.
we
had
formed
no
theories
.
we
were
simply
there
to
observe
and
to
draw
inferences
from
our
observations
.
what
did
we
see
first
?
a
very
placid
and
respectable
lady
,
who
seemed
quite
innocent
of
any
secret
,
and
a
portrait
which
showed
me
that
she
had
two
younger
sisters
.
it
instantly
flashed
across
my
mind
that
the
box
might
have
been
meant
for
one
of
these
.
i
set
the
idea
aside
as
one
which
could
be
disproved
or
confirmed
at
our
leisure
.
then
we
went
to
the
garden
,
as
you
remember
,
and
we
saw
the
very
singular
contents
of
the
little
yellow
box
.
``
the
string
was
of
the
quality
which
is
used
by
sail-makers
aboard
ship
,
and
at
once
a
whiff
of
the
sea
was
perceptible
in
our
investigation
.
when
i
observed
that
the
knot
was
one
which
is
popular
with
sailors
,
that
the
parcel
had
been
posted
at
a
port
,
and
that
the
male
ear
was
pierced
for
an
earring
which
is
so
much
more
common
among
sailors
than
landsmen
,
i
was
quite
certain
that
all
the
actors
in
the
tragedy
were
to
be
found
among
our
seafaring
classes
.
``
when
i
came
to
examine
the
address
of
the
packet
i
observed
that
it
was
to
miss
s.
cushing
.
now
,
the
oldest
sister
would
,
of
course
,
be
miss
cushing
,
and
although
her
initial
was
`
s
'
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
others
as
well
.
in
that
case
we
should
have
to
commence
our
investigation
from
a
fresh
basis
altogether
.
i
therefore
went
into
the
house
with
the
intention
of
clearing
up
this
point
.
i
was
about
to
assure
miss
cushing
that
i
was
convinced
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
when
you
may
remember
that
i
came
suddenly
to
a
stop
.
the
fact
was
that
i
had
just
seen
something
which
filled
me
with
surprise
and
at
the
same
time
narrowed
the
field
of
our
inquiry
immensely
.
``
as
a
medical
man
,
you
are
aware
,
watson
,
that
there
is
no
part
of
the
body
which
varies
so
much
as
the
human
ear
.
each
ear
is
as
a
rule
quite
distinctive
and
differs
from
all
other
ones
.
in
last
year
's
anthropological
journal
you
will
find
two
short
monographs
from
my
pen
upon
the
subject
.
i
had
,
therefore
,
examined
the
ears
in
the
box
with
the
eyes
of
an
expert
and
had
carefully
noted
their
anatomical
peculiarities
.
imagine
my
surprise
,
then
,
when
on
looking
at
miss
cushing
i
perceived
that
her
ear
corresponded
exactly
with
the
female
ear
which
i
had
just
inspected
.
the
matter
was
entirely
beyond
coincidence
.
there
was
the
same
shortening
of
the
pinna
,
the
same
broad
curve
of
the
upper
lobe
,
the
same
convolution
of
the
inner
cartilage
.
in
all
essentials
it
was
the
same
ear
.
``
in
the
first
place
,
her
sister
's
name
was
sarah
,
and
her
address
had
until
recently
been
the
same
,
so
that
it
was
quite
obvious
how
the
mistake
had
occurred
and
for
whom
the
packet
was
meant
.
then
we
heard
of
this
steward
,
married
to
the
third
sister
,
and
learned
that
he
had
at
one
time
been
so
intimate
with
miss
sarah
that
she
had
actually
gone
up
to
liverpool
to
be
near
the
browners
,
but
a
quarrel
had
afterwards
divided
them
.
this
quarrel
had
put
a
stop
to
all
communications
for
some
months
,
so
that
if
browner
had
occasion
to
address
a
packet
to
miss
sarah
,
he
would
undoubtedly
have
done
so
to
her
old
address
.
``
and
now
the
matter
had
begun
to
straighten
itself
out
wonderfully
.
we
had
learned
of
the
existence
of
this
steward
,
an
impulsive
man
,
of
strong
passions
--
you
remember
that
he
threw
up
what
must
have
been
a
very
superior
berth
in
order
to
be
nearer
to
his
wife
--
subject
,
too
,
to
occasional
fits
of
hard
drinking
.
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
his
wife
had
been
murdered
,
and
that
a
man
--
presumably
a
seafaring
man
--
had
been
murdered
at
the
same
time
.
jealousy
,
of
course
,
at
once
suggests
itself
as
the
motive
for
the
crime
.
and
why
should
these
proofs
of
the
deed
be
sent
to
miss
sarah
cushing
?
probably
because
during
her
residence
in
liverpool
she
had
some
hand
in
bringing
about
the
events
which
led
to
the
tragedy
.
you
will
observe
that
this
line
of
boats
call
at
belfast
,
dublin
,
and
waterford
;
so
that
,
presuming
that
browner
had
committed
the
deed
and
had
embarked
at
once
upon
his
steamer
,
the
may
day
,
belfast
would
be
the
first
place
at
which
he
could
post
his
terrible
packet
.
``
a
second
solution
was
at
this
stage
obviously
possible
,
and
although
i
thought
it
exceedingly
unlikely
,
i
was
determined
to
elucidate
it
before
going
further
.
an
unsuccessful
lover
might
have
killed
mr.
and
mrs.
browner
,
and
the
male
ear
might
have
belonged
to
the
husband
.
there
were
many
grave
objections
to
this
theory
,
but
it
was
conceivable
.
i
therefore
sent
off
a
telegram
to
my
friend
algar
,
of
the
liverpool
force
,
and
asked
him
to
find
out
if
mrs.
browner
were
at
home
,
and
if
browner
had
departed
in
the
may
day
.
then
we
went
on
to
wallington
to
visit
miss
sarah
.
``
i
was
curious
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
see
how
far
the
family
ear
had
been
reproduced
in
her
.
then
,
of
course
,
she
might
give
us
very
important
information
,
but
i
was
not
sanguine
that
she
would
.
she
must
have
heard
of
the
business
the
day
before
,
since
all
croydon
was
ringing
with
it
,
and
she
alone
could
have
understood
for
whom
the
packet
was
meant
.
if
she
had
been
willing
to
help
justice
she
would
probably
have
communicated
with
the
police
already
.
however
,
it
was
clearly
our
duty
to
see
her
,
so
we
went
.
we
found
that
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
packet
--
for
her
illness
dated
from
that
time
--
had
such
an
effect
upon
her
as
to
bring
on
brain
fever
.
it
was
clearer
than
ever
that
she
understood
its
full
significance
,
but
equally
clear
that
we
should
have
to
wait
some
time
for
any
assistance
from
her
.
``
however
,
we
were
really
independent
of
her
help
.
our
answers
were
waiting
for
us
at
the
police-station
,
where
i
had
directed
algar
to
send
them
.
nothing
could
be
more
conclusive
.
mrs.
browner
's
house
had
been
closed
for
more
than
three
days
,
and
the
neighbours
were
of
opinion
that
she
had
gone
south
to
see
her
relatives
.
it
had
been
ascertained
at
the
shipping
offices
that
browner
had
left
aboard
of
the
may
day
,
and
i
calculate
that
she
is
due
in
the
thames
tomorrow
night
.
when
he
arrives
he
will
be
met
by
the
obtuse
but
resolute
lestrade
,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
have
all
our
details
filled
in
.
''
sherlock
holmes
was
not
disappointed
in
his
expectations
.
two
days
later
he
received
a
bulky
envelope
,
which
contained
a
short
note
from
the
detective
,
and
a
typewritten
document
,
which
covered
several
pages
of
foolscap
.
``
lestrade
has
got
him
all
right
,
''
said
holmes
,
glancing
up
at
me
.
``
perhaps
it
would
interest
you
to
hear
what
he
says
.
``
my
dear
mr.
holmes
:
in
accordance
with
the
scheme
which
we
had
formed
in
order
to
test
our
theories

``
i
went
down
to
the
albert
dock
yesterday
at
6
p.m.
,
and
boarded
the
s.s.
may
day
,
belonging
to
the
liverpool
,
dublin
,
and
london
steam
packet
company
.
on
inquiry
,
i
found
that
there
was
a
steward
on
board
of
the
name
of
james
browner
and
that
he
had
acted
during
the
voyage
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
that
the
captain
had
been
compelled
to
relieve
him
of
his
duties
.
on
descending
to
his
berth
,
i
found
him
seated
upon
a
chest
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
hands
,
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
.
he
is
a
big
,
powerful
chap
,
clean-shaven
,
and
very
swarthy
--
something
like
aldrige
,
who
helped
us
in
the
bogus
laundry
affair
.
he
jumped
up
when
he
heard
my
business
,
and
i
had
my
whistle
to
my
lips
to
call
a
couple
of
river
police
,
who
were
round
the
corner
,
but
he
seemed
to
have
no
heart
in
him
,
and
he
held
out
his
hands
quietly
enough
for
the
darbies
.
we
brought
him
along
to
the
cells
,
and
his
box
as
well
,
for
we
thought
there
might
be
something
incriminating
;
but
,
bar
a
big
sharp
knife
such
as
most
sailors
have
,
we
got
nothing
for
our
trouble
.
however
,
we
find
that
we
shall
want
no
more
evidence
,
for
on
being
brought
before
the
inspector
at
the
station
he
asked
leave
to
make
a
statement
,
which
was
,
of
course
,
taken
down
,
just
as
he
made
it
,
by
our
shorthand
man
.
we
had
three
copies
typewritten
,
one
of
which
i
enclose
.
the
affair
proves
,
as
i
always
thought
it
would
,
to
be
an
extremely
simple
one
,
but
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
assisting
me
in
my
investigation
.
with
kind
regards
,
``
yours
very
truly
,
``
g.
lestrade
.
``
hum
!
the
investigation
really
was
a
very
simple
one
,
''
remarked
holmes
,
``
but
i
do
n't
think
it
struck
him
in
that
light
when
he
first
called
us
in
.
however
,
let
us
see
what
jim
browner
has
to
say
for
himself
.
this
is
his
statement
as
made
before
inspector
montgomery
at
the
shadwell
police
station
,
and
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
verbatim
.
''
``
`
have
i
anything
to
say
?
yes
,
i
have
a
deal
to
say
.
i
have
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
all
.
you
can
hang
me
,
or
you
can
leave
me
alone
.
i
do
n't
care
a
plug
which
you
do
.
i
tell
you
i
've
not
shut
an
eye
in
sleep
since
i
did
it
,
and
i
do
n't
believe
i
ever
will
again

i
get
past
all
waking

sometimes
it
's
his
face
,
but
most
generally
it
's
hers
.
i
'm
never
without
one
or
the

before
me

he
looks
frowning
and
black-like
,
but
she
has
a
kind
o
'
surprise
upon
her
face
.
ay
,
the
white
lamb
,
she
might
well
be
surprised
when
she
read
death
on
a
face
that
had
seldom
looked
anything
but
love
upon
her
before
.
``
`
but
it
was
sarah
's
fault
,
and
may
the
curse
of
a
broken
man
put
a
blight
on
her
and
set
the
blood
rotting
in
her
veins
!
it
's
not
that
i
want
to
clear
myself
.
i
know
that
i
went
back
to
drink
,
like
the
beast
that
i
was
.
but
she
would
have
forgiven
me
;
she
would
have
stuck
as
close
to
me
as
a
rope
to
a
block
if
that
woman
had
never
darkened
our
door
.
for
sarah
cushing
loved
me
--
that
's
the
root
of
the
business
--
she
loved
me
until
all
her
love
turned
to
poisonous
hate
when
she
knew
that
i
thought
more
of
my
wife
's
footmark
in
the
mud
than
i
did
of
her
whole
body
and
soul
.
``
`
there
were
three
sisters
altogether
.
the
old
one
was
just
a
good
woman
,
the
second
was
a
devil
,
and
the
third
was
an
angel
.
sarah
was
thirty-three
,
and
mary
was
twenty-nine
when
i
married
.
we
were
just
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
when
we
set
up
house
together
,
and
in
all
liverpool
there
was
no
better
woman
than
my
mary
.
and
then
we
asked
sarah
up
for
a
week
,
and
the
week
grew
into
a
month
,
and
one
thing
led
to
another
,
until
she
was
just
one
of
ourselves
.
``
`
i
was
blue
ribbon
at
that
time
,
and
we
were
putting
a
little
money
by
,
and
all
was
as
bright
as
a
new
dollar
.
my
god
,
whoever
would
have
thought
that
it
could
have
come
to
this
?
whoever
would
have
dreamed
it
?
``
`
i
used
to
be
home
for
the
week-ends
very
often
,
and
sometimes
if
the
ship
were
held
back
for
cargo
i
would
have
a
whole
week
at
a
time
,
and
in
this
way
i
saw
a
deal
of
my
sister-in-law
,
sarah
.
she
was
a
fine
tall
woman
,
black
and
quick
and
fierce
,
with
a
proud
way
of
carrying
her
head
,
and
a
glint
from
her
eye
like
a
spark
from
a
flint
.
but
when
little
mary
was
there
i
had
never
a
thought
of
her
,
and
that
i
swear
as
i
hope
for
god
's
mercy
.
``
`
it
had
seemed
to
me
sometimes
that
she
liked
to
be
alone
with
me
,
or
to
coax
me
out
for
a
walk
with
her
,
but
i
had
never
thought
anything
of
that
.
but
one
evening
my
eyes
were
opened
.
i
had
come
up
from
the
ship
and
found
my
wife
out
,
but
sarah
at
home
.
``
where
's
mary
?
''
i
asked
.
``
oh
,
she
has
gone
to
pay
some
accounts
.
''
i
was
impatient
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
.
``
ca
n't
you
be
happy
for
five
minutes
without
mary
,
jim
?
''
says
she
.
``
it
's
a
bad
compliment
to
me
that
you
ca
n't
be
contented
with
my
society
for
so
short
a
time
.
''
``
that
's
all
right
,
my
lass
,
''
said
i
,
putting
out
my
hand
towards
her
in
a
kindly
way
,
but
she
had
it
in
both
hers
in
an
instant
,
and
they
burned
as
if
they
were
in
a
fever
.
i
looked
into
her
eyes
and
i
read
it
all
there
.
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
speak
,
nor
for
me
either
.
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
speak
,
nor
for
me
either
.
i
frowned
and
drew
my
hand
away
.
then
she
stood
by
my
side
in
silence
for
a
bit
,
and
then
put
up
her
hand
and
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
.
``
steady
old
jim
!
''
said
she
,
and
with
a
kind
o
'
mocking
laugh
,
she
ran
out
of
the
room
.
``
`
well
,
from
that
time
sarah
hated
me
with
her
whole
heart
and
soul
,
and
she
is
a
woman
who
can
hate
,
too
.
i
was
a
fool
to
let
her
go
on
biding
with
us
--
a
besotted
fool
--
but
i
never
said
a
word
to
mary
,
for
i
knew
it
would
grieve
her
.
things
went
on
much
as
before
,
but
after
a
time
i
began
to
find
that
there
was
a
bit
of
a
change
in
mary
herself
.
she
had
always
been
so
trusting
and
so
innocent
,
but
now
she
became
queer
and
suspicious
,
wanting
to
know
where
i
had
been
and
what
i
had
been
doing
,
and
whom
my
letters
were
from
,
and
what
i
had
in
my
pockets
,
and
a
thousand
such
follies
.
day
by
day
she
grew
queerer
and
more
irritable
,
and
we
had
ceaseless
rows
about
nothing
.
i
was
fairly
puzzled
by
it
all
.
sarah
avoided
me
now
,
but
she
and
mary
were
just
inseparable
.
i
can
see
now
how
she
was
plotting
and
scheming
and
poisoning
my
wife
's
mind
against
me
,
but
i
was
such
a
blind
beetle
that
i
could
not
understand
it
at
the
time
.
then
i
broke
my
blue
ribbon
and
began
to
drink
again
,
but
i
think
i
should
not
have
done
it
if
mary
had
been
the
same
as
ever
.
she
had
some
reason
to
be
disgusted
with
me
now
,
and
the
gap
between
us
began
to
be
wider
and
wider
.
and
then
this
alec
fairbairn
chipped
in
,
and
things
became
a
thousand
times
blacker
.
``
`
it
was
to
see
sarah
that
he
came
to
my
house
first
,
but
soon
it
was
to
see
us
,
for
he
was
a
man
with
winning
ways
,
and
he
made
friends
wherever
he
went
.
he
was
a
dashing
,
swaggering
chap
,
smart
and
curled
,
who
had
seen
half
the
world
and
could
talk
of
what
he
had
seen
.
he
was
good
company
,
i
wo
n't
deny
it
,
and
he
had
wonderful
polite
ways
with
him
for
a
sailor
man
,
so
that
i
think
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
he
knew
more
of
the
poop
than
the
forecastle
.
for
a
month
he
was
in
and
out
of
my
house
,
and
never
once
did
it
cross
my
mind
that
harm
might
come
of
his
soft
,
tricky
ways
.
and
then
at
last
something
made
me
suspect
,
and
from
that
day
my
peace
was
gone
forever
.
``
`
it
was
only
a
little
thing
,
too
.
i
had
come
into
the
parlour
unexpected
,
and
as
i
walked
in
at
the
door
i
saw
a
light
of
welcome
on
my
wife
's
face
.
but
as
she
saw
who
it
was
it
faded
again
,
and
she
turned
away
with
a
look
of
disappointment
.
that
was
enough
for
me
.
there
was
no
one
but
alec
fairbairn
whose
step
she
could
have
mistaken
for
mine
.
if
i
could
have
seen
him
then
i
should
have
killed
him
,
for
i
have
always
been
like
a
madman
when
my
temper
gets
loose
.
mary
saw
the
devil
's
light
in
my
eyes
,
and
she
ran
forward
with
her
hands
on
my
sleeve
.
``
do
n't
,
jim
,
do
n't
!
''
says
she
.
``
do
n't
,
jim
,
do
n't
!
''
says
she
.
``
where
's
sarah
?
''
i
asked
.
``
in
the
kitchen
,
''
says
she
.
``
sarah
,
''
says
i
as
i
went
in
,
``
this
man
fairbairn
is
never
to
darken
my
door
again
.
''
``
why
not
?
''
says
she
.
``
because
i
order
it
.
''
``
oh
!
''
says
she
,
``
if
my
friends
are
not
good
enough
for
this
house
,
then
i
am
not
good
enough
for
it
either
.
''
``
oh
!
''
says
she
,
``
if
my
friends
are
not
good
enough
for
this
house
,
then
i
am
not
good
enough
for
it
either
.
''
``
you
can
do
what
you
like
,
''
says
i
,
``
but
if
fairbairn
shows
his
face
here
again
i
'll
send
you
one
of
his
ears
for
a
keepsake
.
''
she
was
frightened
by
my
face
,
i
think
,
for
she
never
answered
a
word
,
and
the
same
evening
she
left
my
house
.
``
`
well
,
i
do
n't
know
now
whether
it
was
pure
devilry
on
the
part
of
this
woman
,
or
whether
she
thought
that
she
could
turn
me
against
my
wife
by
encouraging
her
to
misbehave
.
anyway
,
she
took
a
house
just
two
streets
off
and
let
lodgings
to
sailors
.
fairbairn
used
to
stay
there
,
and
mary
would
go
round
to
have
tea
with
her
sister
and
him
.
how
often
she
went
i
do
n't
know
,
but
i
followed
her
one
day
,
and
as
i
broke
in
at
the
door
fairbairn
got
away
over
the
back
garden
wall
,
like
the
cowardly
skunk
that
he
was
.
i
swore
to
my
wife
that
i
would
kill
her
if
i
found
her
in
his
company
again
,
and
i
led
her
back
with
me
,
sobbing
and
trembling
,
and
as
white
as
a
piece
of
paper
.
there
was
no
trace
of
love
between
us
any
longer
.
i
could
see
that
she
hated
me
and
feared
me
,
and
when
the
thought
of
it
drove
me
to
drink
,
then
she
despised
me
as
well
.
``
`
well
,
sarah
found
that
she
could
not
make
a
living
in
liverpool
,
so
she
went
back
,
as
i
understand
,
to
live
with
her
sister
in
croydon
,
and
things
jogged
on
much
the
same
as
ever
at
home
.
and
then
came
this
week
and
all
the
misery
and
ruin
.
``
'it
was
in
this
way
.
we
had
gone
on
the
may
day
for
a
round
voyage
of
seven
days
,
but
a
hogshead
got
loose
and
started
one
of
our
plates
,
so
that
we
had
to
put
back
into
port
for
twelve
hours
.
i
left
the
ship
and
came
home
,
thinking
what
a
surprise
it
would
be
for
my
wife
,
and
hoping
that
maybe
she
would
be
glad
to
see
me
so
soon
.
the
thought
was
in
my
head
as
i
turned
into
my
own
street
,
and
at
that
moment
a
cab
passed
me
,
and
there
she
was
,
sitting
by
the
side
of
fairbairn
,
the
two
chatting
and
laughing
,
with
never
a
thought
for
me
as
i
stood
watching
them
from
the
footpath
.
``
`
i
tell
you
,
and
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
,
that
from
that
moment
i
was
not
my
own
master
,
and
it
is
all
like
a
dim
dream
when
i
look
back
on
it
.
i
had
been
drinking
hard
of
late
,
and
the
two
things
together
fairly
turned
my
brain
.
there
's
something
throbbing
in
my
head
now
,
like
a
docker
's
hammer
,
but
that
morning
i
seemed
to
have
all
niagara
whizzing
and
buzzing
in
my
ears
.
``
'well
,
i
took
to
my
heels
,
and
i
ran
after
the
cab
.
i
had
a
heavy
oak
stick
in
my
hand
,
and
i
tell
you
i
saw
red
from
the
first
;
but
as
i
ran
i
got
cunning
,
too
,
and
hung
back
a
little
to
see
them
without
being
seen
.
they
pulled
up
soon
at
the
railway
station
.
there
was
a
good
crowd
round
the
booking-office
,
so
i
got
quite
close
to
them
without
being
seen
.
they
took
tickets
for
new
brighton
.
so
did
i
,
but
i
got
in
three
carriages
behind
them
.
when
we
reached
it
they
walked
along
the
parade
,
and
i
was
never
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
them
.
at
last
i
saw
them
hire
a
boat
and
start
for
a
row
,
for
it
was
a
very
hot
day
,
and
they
thought
,
no
doubt
,
that
it
would
be
cooler
on
the
water
.
``
`
it
was
just
as
if
they
had
been
given
into
my
hands
.
there
was
a
bit
of
a
haze
,
and
you
could
not
see
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
.
i
hired
a
boat
for
myself
,
and
i
pulled
after
them
.
i
could
see
the
blur
of
their
craft
,
but
they
were
going
nearly
as
fast
as
i
,
and
they
must
have
been
a
long
mile
from
the
shore
before
i
caught
them
up
.
the
haze
was
like
a
curtain
all
round
us
,
and
there
were
we
three
in
the
middle
of
it
.
my
god
,
shall
i
ever
forget
their
faces
when
they
saw
who
was
in
the
boat
that
was
closing
in
upon
them
?
she
screamed
out
.
he
swore
like
a
madman
and
jabbed
at
me
with
an
oar
,
for
he
must
have
seen
death
in
my
eyes
.
i
got
past
it
and
got
one
in
with
my
stick
that
crushed
his
head
like
an
egg
.
i
would
have
spared
her
,
perhaps
,
for
all
my
madness
,
but
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
,
crying
out
to
him
,
and
calling
him
``
alec
.
''
i
struck
again
,
and
she
lay
stretched
beside
him
.
i
was
like
a
wild
beast
then
that
had
tasted
blood
.
if
sarah
had
been
there
,
by
the
lord
,
she
should
have
joined
them
.
i
pulled
out
my
knife
,
and
--
well
,
there
!
i
've
said
enough
.
it
gave
me
a
kind
of
savage
joy
when
i
thought
how
sarah
would
feel
when
she
had
such
signs
as
these
of
what
her
meddling
had
brought
about
.
then
i
tied
the
bodies
into
the
boat
,
stove
a
plank
,
and
stood
by
until
they
had
sunk
.
i
knew
very
well
that
the
owner
would
think
that
they
had
lost
their
bearings
in
the
haze
,
and
had
drifted
off
out
to
sea
.
i
cleaned
myself
up
,
got
back
to
land
,
and
joined
my
ship
without
a
soul
having
a
suspicion
of
what
had
passed
.
that
night
i
made
up
the
packet
for
sarah
cushing
,
and
next
day
i
sent
it
from
belfast
.
``
`
there
you
have
the
whole
truth
of
it
.
you
can
hang
me
,
or
do
what
you
like
with
me
,
but
you
can
not
punish
me
as
i
have
been
punished
already
.
i
can
not
shut
my
eyes
but
i
see
those
two
faces
staring
at
me
--
staring
at
me
as
they
stared
when
my
boat
broke
through
the
haze
.
i
killed
them
quick
,
but
they
are
killing
me
slow
;
and
if
i
have
another
night
of
it
i
shall
be
either
mad
or
dead
before
morning
.
you
wo
n't
put
me
alone
into
a
cell
,
sir
?
for
pity
's
sake
do
n't
,
and
may
you
be
treated
in
your
day
of
agony
as
you
treat
me
now
.
'
``
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
,
watson
?
''
said
holmes
solemnly
as
he
laid
down
the
paper
.
``
what
object
is
served
by
this
circle
of
misery
and
violence
and
fear
?
it
must
tend
to
some
end
,
or
else
our
universe
is
ruled
by
chance
,
which
is
unthinkable
.
but
what
end
?
there
is
the
great
standing
perennial
problem
to
which
human
reason
is
as
far
from
an
answer
as
ever
.

``

''
so
spoke
sherlock
holmes
and
turned
back
to
the
great
scrapbook
in
which
he
was
arranging
and
indexing
some
of
his
recent
material
.
but
the
landlady
had
the
pertinacity
and
also
the
cunning
of
her
sex
.
she
held
her
ground
firmly
.
``
you
arranged
an
affair
for
a
lodger
of
mine
last
year

''
she
said
--
``
mr.

''
``
ah
,
yes

a
simple
matter
.
''
``
but
he
would
never
cease
talking
of
it
--
your
kindness
,
sir
,
and
the
way
in
which
you
brought
light
into
the
darkness
.
i
remembered
his
words

was
in
doubt
and
darkness
myself
.
i
know
you
could

only
would

''
holmes
was
accessible
upon
the
side
of
flattery
,
and
also
,
to
do
him
justice
,
upon
the
side
of
kindliness
.
the
two
forces
made
him
lay
down
his
gum-brush
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
and
push
back
his
chair
.
``

you
are
uneasy
,
as
i

your
new
lodger
remains
in
his
rooms

you
can
not

''
``
no

this
is
different
.
it
frightens
me
,
mr.
holmes
.
i
ca
n't
sleep
for
fright
.
to
hear
his
quick
step
moving
here
and
moving
there
from
early
morning
to
late
at
night
,
and
yet
never
to
catch
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
him
--
it
's
more
than
i
can
stand

my
husband
is
as
nervous
over
it

i

he
is
out
at
his
work
all

get
no

from
it

is

hiding
for

what
has

for

all
alone

''
holmes
leaned
forward
and
laid
his
long
,
thin
fingers
upon
the
woman
's
shoulder
.
he
had
an
almost
hypnotic
power
of
soothing
when
he
wished
.
the
scared
look
faded
from
her
eyes
,
and
her
agitated
features
smoothed
into
their
usual
commonplace
.
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
which
he
had
indicated
.
``
if
i
take
it
up
i
must
understand
every
detail

''
said
he
.
``

time
to

paid
you
for

board

``
he
asked

bedroom

all
complete
,
at
the
top
of

``

``
he
said

mr.

earns
little
,
and
the
money
meant
much
to

he
took
out

he
held
it
out

there

``

were
that

to
have
a
key
of
the
house

often
have
them

,

neither

i

can
hear
that

his
pacing
up

down

up
and
down
,
night
,
morning
,
and
noon
;

on

night

never

went
out
the

did
he
?
''
``
yes

returned
very
late
--
after
we
were
all
in

he
told
me
after
he
had
taken
the
rooms
that
he
would
do
so

asked
me
not
to
bar
the
door

i
heard
him
come
up
the
stair
after
midnight
.
''
``

his
meals
?
''
``
it
was
his
particular
direction
that
we
should
always
,
when
he
rang
,
leave
his
meal
upon
a
chair

outside
his
door
.
then
he
rings
again
when
he
has
finished
,

we
take
it
down
from

if
he
wants
anything

engaged
them

''
``
why
should
you
think
so
?
''
``
well
,
apart
from
this
cigarette-end
,
was
it
not
suggestive
that
the
only
time
the
lodger
went
out
was
immediately
after
his
taking
the
rooms
?
he
came
back
--
or
someone
came
back
--
when
all
witnesses
were
out
of
the
way
.
we
have
no
proof
that
the
person
who
came
back
was
the
person
who
went
out

then
,
again

the

took
the

i
can
imagine
that
the

taken
out
of
a
dictionary
,
which
would
give
the

not
the
plural

the
laconic
style
may
be
to
conceal
the
absence
of
knowledge
of
english

yes
,
watson
,
there
are
good
reasons
to
suspect
that
there
has
been
a
substitution
of
lodgers

``

for
what
possible
end
?
''
``
ah
!
there
lies
our
problem
.
there
is
one
rather
obvious
line
of
investigation

''
he
took
down
the
great
book
in
which
,
day
by
day
,
he
filed
the
agony
columns
of
the
various
london
journals

``

''
said
he
,
turning
over
the
pages
,
``

a
chorus
of

by

there
seems
no

fortunately

nothing

grow
more
intelligible

so
it
proved
;
for
in
the
morning
i
found
my
friend
standing
on
the
hearthrug
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
a
smile
of
complete
satisfaction
upon
his
face
.
``
how
's
this

he
cried
,
picking
up
the

must
make
a
little
reconnaissance
of

neighbourhood
.
ah
,
mrs.
warren
!
what
news
do
you
bring
us
this
morning
?
''
our
client
had
suddenly
burst
into
the
room
with
an
explosive
energy
which
told
of
some
new
and
momentous
development
.
``
it
's
a
police
matter
,
mr.
holmes
!
''
she
cried
.
``
i
'll
have
no
more
of
it

he
shall
pack
out
of
there
with
his
baggage

i
would
have
gone
straight
up
and
told
him
so
,
only
i
thought
it
was
but
fair
to
you
to
take
your
opinion
first
.
but
i
'm
at
the
end
of
my
patience
,
and
when
it
comes
to
knocking
my
old
man
about
--
''
``
knocking
mr.
warren
about
?
''
``
using
him
roughly
,
anyway
.
''
``
but
who
used
him
roughly
?
''
``
ah
!
that
's
what
we
want
to
know
!
it
was
this
morning
,
sir
.
mr.
warren
is
a
timekeeper
at
morton
and
waylight
's
,
in
tottenham
court
road
.
he
has
to
be
out
of
the
house
before
seven
.
well
,
this
morning
he
had
not
gone
ten
paces
down
the
road
when
two
men
came
up
behind
him
,
threw
a
coat
over
his
head
,
and
bundled
him
into
a
cab
that
was
beside
the
curb
.
they
drove
him
an
hour
,
and
then
opened
the
door
and
shot
him
out
.
he
lay
in
the
roadway
so
shaken
in
his
wits
that
he
never
saw
what
became
of
the
cab
.
when
he
picked
himself
up
he
found
he
was
on
hampstead
heath
;
so
he
took
a
bus
home
,
and
there
he
lies
now
on
his
sofa
,
while
i
came
straight
round
to
tell
you
what
had
happened
.
''
``
most
interesting
,
''
said
holmes
.
``
did
he
observe
the
appearance
of
these
men
--
did
he
hear
them
talk
?
''
``
no
;
he
is
clean
dazed
.
he
just
knows
that
he
was
lifted
up
as
if
by
magic
and
dropped
as
if
by
magic
.
two
at
least
were
in
it
,
and
maybe
three
.
''
``
and
you
connect
this
attack
with
your
lodger
?
''
``
well
,
we
've
lived
there
fifteen
years
and
no
such
happenings
ever
came
before
.
i
've
had
enough
of
him
.
money
's
not
everything
.
i
'll
have
him
out
of
my
house
before
the
day
is
done
.
''
``
wait
a
bit
,
mrs.
warren
.
do
nothing
rash
.
i
begin
to
think
that
this
affair
may
be
very
much
more
important
than
appeared
at
first
sight
.
it
is
clear
now
that
some
danger
is
threatening
your
lodger
.
it
is
equally
clear
that
his
enemies
,
lying
in
wait
for
him
near
your
door
,
mistook
your
husband
for
him
in
the
foggy
morning
light
.
on
discovering
their
mistake
they
released
him
.
what
they
would
have
done
had
it
not
been
a
mistake
,
we
can
only
conjecture
.
''
``
well
,
what
am
i
to
do
,
mr.
holmes
?
''
``
i
have
a
great
fancy
to
see
this
lodger
of
yours
,
mrs.
warren
.
''
``
i
do
n't
see
how
that
is
to
be
managed
,
unless
you
break
in
the
door
.
i
always
hear
him
unlock
it
as
i
go
down
the
stair
after
i
leave
the
tray
.
''
``
he
has
to
take
the
tray
in
.
surely
we
could
conceal
ourselves
and
see
him
do
it
.
''
the
landlady
thought
for
a
moment
.
``
well
,
sir
,
there
's
the
box-room
opposite
.
i
could
arrange
a
looking-glass
,
maybe
,
and
if
you
were
behind
the
door
--
''
``
excellent
!
''
said
holmes
.
``
when
does
he
lunch
?
''
``
about
one
,
sir
.
''
``
then
dr.
watson
and
i
will
come
round
in
time
.
for
the
present
,
mrs.
warren
,
good-bye
.
''
at
half-past
twelve
we
found
ourselves
upon
the
steps
of
mrs.
warren
's
house
--
a
high
,
thin
,
yellow-brick
edifice
in
great
orme
street
,
a
narrow
thoroughfare
at
the
northeast
side
of
the
british
museum
.
standing
as
it
does
near
the
corner
of
the
street
,
it
commands
a
view
down
howe
street
,
with
its
more
pretentious
houses
.
holmes
pointed
with
a
chuckle
to
one
of
these
,
a
row
of
residential
flats
,
which
projected
so
that
they
could
not
fail
to
catch
the
eye
.
``
see
,
watson
!
''
said
he
.
``
`
high
red
house
with
stone
facings
.
'
there
is
the
signal
station
all
right
.
we
know
the
place
,
and
we
know
the
code
;
so
surely
our
task
should
be
simple
.
there
's
a
`
to
let
'
card
in
that
window
.
it
is
evidently
an
empty
flat
to
which
the
confederate
has
access
.
well
,
mrs.
warren
,
what
now
?
''
``
i
have
it
all
ready
for
you
.
if
you
will
both
come
up
and
leave
your
boots
below
on
the
landing
,
i
'll
put
you
there
now
.
''
it
was
an
excellent
hiding-place
which
she
had
arranged
.
the
mirror
was
so
placed
that
,
seated
in
the
dark
,
we
could
very
plainly
see
the
door
opposite
.
we
had
hardly
settled
down
in
it
,
and
mrs.
warren
left
us
,
when
a
distant
tinkle
announced
that
our
mysterious
neighbour
had
rung
.
presently
the
landlady
appeared
with
the
tray
,
laid
it
down
upon
a
chair
beside
the
closed
door
,
and
then
,
treading
heavily
,
departed
.
crouching
together
in
the
angle
of
the
door
,
we
kept
our
eyes
fixed
upon
the
mirror
.
suddenly
,
as
the
landlady
's
footsteps
died
away
,
there
was
the
creak
of
a
turning
key
,
the
handle
revolved
,
and
two
thin
hands
darted
out
and
lifted
the
tray
from
the
chair
.
an
instant
later
it
was
hurriedly
replaced
,
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
dark
,
beautiful
,
horrified
face
glaring
at
the
narrow
opening
of
the
box-room
.
then
the
door
crashed
to
,
the
key
turned
once
more
,
and
all
was
silence
.
holmes
twitched
my
sleeve
,
and
together
we
stole
down
the
stair
.
``
i
will
call
again
in
the
evening
,
''
said
he
to
the
expectant
landlady
.
``
i
think
,
watson
,
we
can
discuss
this
business
better
in
our
own
quarters
.
''
``
my
surmise
,
as
you
saw
,
proved
to
be
correct
,
''
said
he
,
speaking
from
the
depths
of
his
easy-chair
.
``
there
has
been
a
substitution
of
lodgers
.
what
i
did
not
foresee
is
that
we
should
find
a
woman
,
and
no
ordinary
woman

did
not

is
that

woman
,
and
no

,
watson
.
''
``
she
saw
us
.
''
``
well
,
she
saw
something
to
alarm
her
.
that
is
certain
.
the
general
sequence
of
events
is
pretty
clear
,
is
it
not
?
a
couple
seek
refuge
in
london
from
a
very
terrible
and
instant
danger
.
the
measure
of
that
danger
is
the
rigour
of
their
precautions
.
the
man
,
who
has
some
work
which
he
must
do
,
desires
to
leave
the
woman
in
absolute
safety
while
he
does
it
.
it
is
not
an
easy
problem
,
but
he
solved
it
in
an
original
fashion
,
and
so
effectively
that
her
presence
was
not
even
known
to
the
landlady
who
supplies
her
with
food
.

the
printed
messages
,
as
is
now
evident
,
were
to
prevent
her
sex
being
discovered
by
her
writing
.
the
man
can
not
come
near
the
woman
,
or
he
will
guide
their
enemies
to
her
.
since
he
can
not
communicate
with
her
direct
,
he
has
recourse
to
the
agony
column
of
a
paper
.
so
far
all
is
clear
.
''
``
but
what
is
at
the
root
of
it
?
''
``
ah
,
yes
,
watson
--
severely
practical
,
as
usual
!
what
is
at
the
root
of
it
all
?
mrs.
warren
's
whimsical
problem
enlarges
somewhat
and
assumes
a
more
sinister
aspect
as
we
proceed
.
this
much
we
can
say
:
that
it
is
no
ordinary
love
escapade
.
you
saw
the
woman
's
face
at
the
sign
of
danger
.
we
have
heard
,
too
,
of
the
attack
upon
the
landlord
,
which
was
undoubtedly
meant
for
the
lodger
.
these
alarms
,
and
the
desperate
need
for
secrecy
,
argue
that
the
matter
is
one
of
life
or
death
.
the
attack
upon
mr.
warren
further
shows
that
the
enemy
,
whoever
they
are
,
are
themselves
not
aware
of
the
substitution
of
the
female
lodger
for
the
male
.
it
is
very
curious
and
complex
,
watson
.
''
``
why
should
you
go
further
in
it
?
what
have
you
to
gain
from
it
?
''
``
what
,
indeed
?
it
is
art
for
art
's
sake
,
watson
.
i
suppose
when
you
doctored
you
found
yourself
studying
cases
without
thought
of
a
fee
?
''
``
for
my
education
,
holmes
.
''
``
education
never
ends

watson
.
it
is
a
series
of
lessons
with
the
greatest
for
the
last

this
is
an
instructive
case
.
there
is
neither
money
nor
credit
in
it
,
and
yet
one
would
wish
to
tidy
it
up
.
when
dusk
comes
we
should
find
ourselves
one
stage
advanced
in
our
investigation
.
''
when
we
returned
to
mrs.
warren
's
rooms
,
the
gloom
of
a
london
winter
evening
had
thickened
into
one
gray
curtain
,
a
dead
monotone
of
colour
,
broken
only
by
the
sharp
yellow
squares
of
the
windows
and
the
blurred
haloes
of
the
gas-lamps
.
as
we
peered
from
the
darkened
sitting-room
of
the
lodging-house
,
one
more
dim
light
glimmered
high
up
through
the
obscurity
.
``
someone
is
moving
in
that
room
,
''
said
holmes
in
a
whisper
,
his
gaunt
and
eager
face
thrust
forward
to
the
window-pane
.
``
yes
,
i
can
see
his
shadow
.
there
he
is
again
!
he
has
a
candle
in
his

now
he
is
peering
across
.
he
wants
to
be
sure
that
she
is
on
the
lookout

now
he
begins
to
flash
.
take
the
message
also

,
that
we
may
check
each
other

a
single
flash

``

my

gave
a
sudden
chuckle
of
comprehension
.

said
he
.

again
we
saw
the
dim
silhouette
of
a
crouching
man
and
the
whisk
of
the
small
flame
across
the
window
as
the
signals
were
renewed
.
they
came
more
rapidly
than
before
--
so
rapid
that
it
was
hard
to
follow
them
.
``

''
the
light
had
suddenly
gone
out
,
the
glimmering
square
of
window
had
disappeared
,
and
the
third
floor
formed
a
dark
band
round
the
lofty
building
,
with
its
tiers
of
shining
casements
.
that
last
warning
cry
had
been
suddenly
cut
short
.
how
,
and
by
whom
?
the
same
thought
occurred
on
the
instant
to
us
both
.
holmes
sprang
up
from
where
he
crouched
by
the
window
.
``
this
is
serious
,
watson
,
''
he
cried
.
``
there
is
some
devilry
going
forward
!
why
should
such
a

us
go
across
ourselves

see
what
we
can
make
of
it
.
''
as
we
walked
rapidly
down
howe
street
i
glanced
back
at
the
building
which
we
had
left
.
there
,
dimly
outlined
at
the
top
window
,
i
could
see
the
shadow
of
a
head
,
a
woman
's
head
,
gazing
tensely
,
rigidly
,
out
into
the
night
,
waiting
with
breathless
suspense
for
the
renewal
of
that
interrupted
message
.
at
the
doorway
of
the
howe
street
flats
a
man
,
muffled
in
a
cravat
and
greatcoat
,
was
leaning
against
the
railing
.
he
started
as
the
hall-light
fell
upon
our
faces
.
``
holmes
!
''
he
cried
.
``
why
,

!
''
said
my
companion
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
scotland
yard
detective
.
``

``

gregson

''
``
yes
,
from

they
broke
off
in

middle
.
we
came
over
to
see
the
reason

but
since
it
is
safe
in
your
hands
i
see
no
object
in
continuing
this
business

``
wait

cried
gregson
eagerly
.
``

'll
do

he
struck
his
stick
sharply
upon
the
ground
,
on
which
a
cabman
,
his
whip
in
his
hand
,
sauntered
over
from
a
four-wheeler
which
stood
on
the
far
side
of
the
street

``
may

introduce
you
to

said
to

the
american
,
a
quiet

businesslike
young
man
,
with
a
clean-shaven
,
hatchet
face
,
flushed
up
at
the
words
of
commendation
.
``
i
am
on
the
trail
of
my

now

said
he
.
``

``

''
``
oh

he

a
european

we
've
learned
all
about

we
know
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
fifty
murders
,
and
yet
we
have
nothing
positive
we
can
take
him
on
.
i
tracked
him
over
from
new
york
,
and
i
've
been
close
to
him
for
a
week
in
london
,
waiting
some
excuse

mr.

i
ran
him
to
ground
in
that
big
tenement
house
,

there
's
only
one
door
,
so
he
ca
n't
slip
us
.
there
's
three
folk
come
out
since
he
went
in
,
but
i
'll
swear
he
was
n't
one
of
them
.
''
``
mr.

talks
of

,
''
said
gregson
.
``
i
expect
,
as
usual
,
he
knows
a
good
deal
that
we
do
n't

''
in
a
few
clear
words
holmes
explained
the
situation
as
it
had
appeared
to
us
.
the
american
struck
his
hands
together
with
vexation
.
``
he
's
on
to
us
!
''
he
cried
.
``
why
do
you
think
so
?
''
``
well
,
it
figures
out
that
way
,
does
it
not

here
he
is
,
sending
out
messages
to
an
accomplice
--
there
are
several
of
his

in

then
suddenly
,
just
as
by
your
own
account
he
was
telling
them
that
there
was
danger
,
he
broke
short
off
.
what
could
it
mean
except
that
from
the
window
he
had
suddenly
either
caught
sight
of
us
in
the
street
,

in
some
way
come
to
understand
how
close
the
danger
was
,
and
that
he
must
act
right
away
if
he
was
to
avoid
it
?
what
do
you
suggest
,
mr.
holmes
?
''
``
that
we
go
up
at
once
and
see
for
ourselves
.
''
``
but
we
have
no
warrant
for
his
arrest
.
''
``
he
is
in
unoccupied
premises
under
suspicious
circumstances
,
''
said
gregson
.
``
that
is
good
enough
for
the
moment
.
when
we
have
him
by
the
heels
we
can
see
if
new
york
ca
n't
help
us
to
keep
him
.
i
'll
take
the
responsibility
of
arresting
him
now
.
''
our
official
detectives
may
blunder
in
the
matter
of
intelligence
,
but
never
in
that
of
courage
.
gregson
climbed
the
stair
to
arrest
this
desperate
murderer
with
the
same
absolutely
quiet
and
businesslike
bearing
with
which
he
would
have
ascended
the
official
staircase
of
scotland
yard
.
the
pinkerton
man
had
tried
to
push
past
him
,
but
gregson
had
firmly
elbowed
him
back
.
london
dangers
were
the
privilege
of
the
london
force
.
the
door
of
the
left-hand
flat
upon
the
third
landing
was
standing
ajar
.
gregson
pushed
it
open
.
within
all
was
absolute
silence
and
darkness
.
i
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
detective
's
lantern
.
as
i
did
so
,
and
as
the
flicker
steadied
into
a
flame
,
we
all
gave
a
gasp
of
surprise
.
on
the
deal
boards
of
the
carpetless
floor
there
was
outlined
a
fresh
track
of
blood
.
the
red
steps
pointed
towards
us
and
led
away
from
an
inner
room
,
the
door
of
which
was
closed
.
gregson
flung
it
open
and
held
his
light
full
blaze
in
front
of
him
,
while
we
all
peered
eagerly
over
his
shoulders
.
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
of
the
empty
room
was
huddled
the
figure
of
an
enormous
man
,
his
clean-shaven
,
swarthy
face
grotesquely
horrible
in
its
contortion
and
his
head
encircled
by
a
ghastly
crimson
halo
of
blood
,
lying
in
a
broad
wet
circle
upon
the
white
woodwork
.
his
knees
were
drawn
up
,
his
hands
thrown
out
in
agony
,
and
from
the
centre
of
his
broad
,
brown
,
upturned
throat
there
projected
the
white
haft
of
a
knife
driven
blade-deep
into
his
body
.
giant
as
he
was
,
the
man
must
have
gone
down
like
a
pole-axed
ox
before
that
terrific
blow
.
beside
his
right
hand
a
most
formidable
horn-handled
,
two-edged
dagger
lay
upon
the
floor
,
and
near
it
a
black
kid
glove
.
``
by
george
!
it
's
black
gorgiano
himself
!
''
cried
the
american
detective
.
``
someone
has
got
ahead
of
us
this
time
.
''
``
here
is
the
candle
in
the
window
,
mr.
holmes
,
''
said
gregson
.
``
why
,
whatever
are
you
doing
?
''
holmes
had
stepped
across
,
had
lit
the
candle
,
and
was
passing
it
backward
and
forward
across
the
window-panes
.
then
he
peered
into
the
darkness
,
blew
the
candle
out
,
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
.
``
i
rather
think
that
will
be
helpful
,
''
said
he
.
he
came
over
and
stood
in
deep
thought
while
the
two
professionals
were
examining
the
body
.
``
you
say
that
three
people
came
out
from
the
flat
while
you
were
waiting
downstairs
,
''
said
he
at
last
.
``
did
you
observe
them
closely
?
''
``
yes
,
i
did
.
''
``
was
there
a
fellow
about
thirty
,
black-bearded
,
dark
,
of
middle
size
?
''
``
yes
;
he
was
the
last
to
pass
me
.
''
``
that
is
your
man
,
i
fancy
.
i
can
give
you
his
description
,
and
we
have
a
very
excellent
outline
of
his
footmark
.
that
should
be
enough
for
you
.
''
``
not
much
,
mr.
holmes
,
among
the
millions
of
london
.
''
``
perhaps
not
.
that
is
why
i
thought
it
best
to
summon
this
lady
to
your
aid
.
''
we
all
turned
round
at
the
words
.
there
,
framed
in
the
doorway
,
was
a
tall
and
beautiful
woman
--
the
mysterious
lodger
of
bloomsbury
.
slowly
she
advanced
,
her
face
pale
and
drawn
with
a
frightful
apprehension
,
her
eyes
fixed
and
staring
,
her
terrified
gaze
riveted
upon
the
dark
figure
on
the
floor
.
``
you
have
killed
him
!
''
she
muttered
.
``
oh
,
dio
mio
,
you
have
killed
him
!
''
then
i
heard
a
sudden
sharp
intake
of
her
breath
,
and
she
sprang
into
the
air
with
a
cry
of
joy
.
round
and
round
the
room
she
danced
,
her
hands
clapping
,
her
dark
eyes
gleaming
with
delighted
wonder
,
and
a
thousand
pretty
italian
exclamations
pouring
from
her
lips
.
it
was
terrible
and
amazing
to
see
such
a
woman
so
convulsed
with
joy
at
such
a
sight
.
suddenly
she
stopped
and
gazed
at
us
all
with
a
questioning
stare
.
``
but
you
!
you
are
police
,
are
you
not
?
you
have
killed
giuseppe
gorgiano
.
is
it
not
so
?
''
``
we
are
police
,
madam
.
''
she
looked
round
into
the
shadows
of
the
room
.
``
but
where
,
then
,
is
gennaro
?
''
she
asked
.
``
he
is
my
husband
,
gennaro
lucca
.
i
am
emilia
lucca
,
and
we
are
both
from
new
york
.
where
is
gennaro
?
he
called
me
this
moment
from
this
window
,
and
i
ran
with
all
my
speed
.
''
``
it
was
i
who
called
,
''
said
holmes
.
``
you
!
how
could
you
call
?
''
``
your
cipher
was
not
difficult
,
madam
.
your
presence
here
was
desirable
.
i
knew
that
i
had
only
to
flash
`
vieni
'
and
you
would
surely
come
.
''
the
beautiful
italian
looked
with
awe
at
my
companion
.
``
i
do
not
understand
how
you
know
these
things
,
''
she
said
.
``
giuseppe
gorgiano
--
how
did
he
--
''
she
paused
,
and
then
suddenly
her
face
lit
up
with
pride
and
delight
.
``
now
i
see
it
!
my
gennaro
!
my
splendid
,
beautiful
gennaro
,
who
has
guarded
me
safe
from
all
harm
,
he
did
it
,
with
his
own
strong
hand

killed
the
monster
!
oh
,
gennaro
,
how
wonderful
you
are
!
what
woman
could
ever
be
worthy
of
such
a
man
?
''
``
well
,
mrs.
lucca
,
''
said
the
prosaic
gregson
,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
lady
's
sleeve
with
as
little
sentiment
as
if
she
were
a
notting
hill
hooligan
,
``
i
am
not
very
clear
yet
who
you
are
or
what
you
are
;
but
you
've
said
enough
to
make
it
very
clear
that
we
shall
want
you
at
the
yard
.
''
``
one
moment
,
gregson
,
''
said
holmes
.
``
i
rather
fancy
that
this
lady
may
be
as
anxious
to
give
us
information
as
we
can
be
to
get
it
.
you
understand
,
madam
,
that
your
husband
will
be
arrested
and
tried
for
the
death
of
the
man
who
lies
before
us
?
what
you
say
may
be
used
in
evidence
.
but
if
you
think
that
he
has
acted
from
motives
which
are
not
criminal
,
and
which
he
would
wish
to
have
known

then
you
can
not

``
now
that
gorgiano
is
dead

fear
nothing

said
the
lady
.
``
he
was
a
devil

monster

suggestion
is
that
we
lock
this
door
,
leave
things
as
we
found
them
,
go
with
this
lady
to
her
room
,
and
form
our
opinion
after
we
have
heard
what
it
is
that
she
has
to
say
to
us
.
''
half
an
hour
later
we
were
seated
,
all
four
,
in
the
small
sitting-room
of
signora
lucca
,
listening
to
her
remarkable
narrative
of
those
sinister
events
,
the
ending
of
which
we
had
chanced
to
witness
.
she
spoke
in
rapid
and
fluent
but
very
unconventional
english
,
which
,
for
the
sake
of
clearness
,
i
will
make
grammatical
.
``
i
was
born
in
posilippo
,
near
naples
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
was
the
daughter
of
augusto
barelli
,
who
was
the
chief
lawyer
and
once
the
deputy
of
that
part
.
gennaro
was
in
my
father
's
employment
,
and
i
came
to
love
him
,
as
any
woman
must
.
he
had
neither
money
nor
position
--
nothing
but
his
beauty
and
strength
and
energy
--
so
my
father
forbade
the
match
.
we
fled
together
,
were
married
at
bari
,
and
sold
my
jewels
to
gain
the
money
which
would
take
us
to
america
.
this
was
four
years
ago
,
and
we
have
been
in
new
york
ever
since
.
``
fortune
was
very
good
to
us
at
first
.
gennaro
was
able
to
do
a
service
to
an
italian
gentleman
--
he
saved
him
from
some
ruffians
in
the
place
called
the
bowery
,
and
so
made
a
powerful
friend
.
his
name
was
tito
castalotte
,
and
he
was
the
senior
partner
of
the
great
firm
of
castalotte
and
zamba
,
who
are
the
chief
fruit
importers
of
new
york
.
signor
zamba
is
an
invalid
,
and
our
new
friend
castalotte
has
all
power
within
the
firm
,
which
employs
more
than
three
hundred
men
.
he
took
my
husband
into
his
employment
,
made
him
head
of
a
department
,
and
showed
his
good-will
towards
him
in
every
way
.
signor
castalotte
was
a
bachelor
,
and
i
believe
that
he
felt
as
if
gennaro
was
his
son
,
and
both
my
husband
and
i
loved
him
as
if
he
were
our
father
.
we
had
taken
and
furnished
a
little
house
in
brooklyn
,
and
our
whole
future
seemed
assured
when
that
black
cloud
appeared
which
was
soon
to
overspread
our
sky
.
``
one
night
,
when
gennaro
returned
from
his
work
,
he
brought
a
fellow-countryman
back
with
him
.
his
name
was
gorgiano
,
and
he
had
come
also
from
posilippo
.
he
was
a
huge
man
,
as
you
can
testify
,
for
you
have
looked
upon
his
corpse
.
not
only
was
his
body
that
of
a
giant
but
everything
about
him
was
grotesque
,
gigantic
,
and
terrifying
.
his
voice
was
like
thunder
in
our
little
house
.
there
was
scarce
room
for
the
whirl
of
his
great
arms
as
he
talked
.
his
thoughts
,
his
emotions
,
his
passions
,
all
were
exaggerated
and
monstrous
.
he
talked
,
or
rather
roared
,
with
such
energy
that
others
could
but
sit
and
listen
,
cowed
with
the
mighty
stream
of
words
.
his
eyes
blazed
at
you
and
held
you
at
his
mercy
.
he
was
a
terrible
and
wonderful
man
.
i
thank
god
that
he
is
dead
!
``
he
came
again
and
again
.
yet
i
was
aware
that
gennaro
was
no
more
happy
than
i
was
in
his
presence
.
my
poor
husband
would
sit
pale
and
listless
,
listening
to
the
endless
raving
upon
politics
and
upon
social
questions
which
made
up
our
visitor
's
conversation
.
gennaro
said
nothing
,
but
i
,
who
knew
him
so
well
,
could
read
in
his
face
some
emotion
which
i
had
never
seen
there
before
.
gennaro
said
nothing
,
but
i
,
who
knew
him
so
well
,
could
read
in
his
face
some
emotion
which
i
had
never
seen
there
before
.
at
first
i
thought
that
it
was
dislike
.
and
then
,
gradually
,
i
understood
that
it
was
more
than
dislike
.
it
was
fear
--
a
deep
,
secret
,
shrinking
fear
.
that
night
--
the
night
that
i
read
his
terror
--
i
put
my
arms
round
him
and
i
implored
him
by
his
love
for
me
and
by
all
that
he
held
dear
to
hold
nothing
from
me
,
and
to
tell
me
why
this
huge
man
overshadowed
him
so
.
``
he
told
me
,
and
my
own
heart
grew
cold
as
ice
as
i
listened
.
my
poor
gennaro
,
in
his
wild
and
fiery
days
,
when
all
the
world
seemed
against
him
and
his
mind
was
driven
half
mad
by
the
injustices
of
life
,
had
joined
a
neapolitan
society
,
the
red
circle
,
which
was
allied
to
the
old
carbonari
.
the
oaths
and
secrets
of
this
brotherhood
were
frightful
,
but
once
within
its
rule
no
escape
was
possible
.
when
we
had
fled
to
america
gennaro
thought
that
he
had
cast
it
all
off
forever
.
what
was
his
horror
one
evening
to
meet
in
the
streets
the
very
man
who
had
initiated
him
in
naples
,
the
giant
gorgiano
,
a
man
who
had
earned
the
name
of
`
death
'
in
the
south
of
italy
,
for
he
was
red
to
the
elbow
in
murder
!
he
had
come
to
new
york
to
avoid
the
italian
police
,
and
he
had
already
planted
a
branch
of
this
dreadful
society
in
his
new
home
.
all
this
gennaro
told
me
and
showed
me
a
summons
which
he
had
received
that
very
day
,
a
red
circle
drawn
upon
the
head
of
it
telling
him
that
a
lodge
would
be
held
upon
a
certain
date
,
and
that
his
presence
at
it
was
required
and
ordered
.
``
that
was
bad
enough
,
but
worse
was
to
come
.
i
had
noticed
for
some
time
that
when
gorgiano
came
to
us
,
as
he
constantly
did
,
in
the
evening
,
he
spoke
much
to
me
;
and
even
when
his
words
were
to
my
husband
those
terrible
,
glaring
,
wild-beast
eyes
of
his
were
always
turned
upon
me
.
one
night
his
secret
came
out
.
i
had
awakened
what
he
called
`
love
'
within
him
--
the
love
of
a
brute
--
a
savage
.
gennaro
had
not
yet
returned
when
he
came
.
he
pushed
his
way
in
,
seized
me
in
his
mighty
arms
,
hugged
me
in
his
bear
's
embrace
,
covered
me
with
kisses
,
and
implored
me
to
come
away
with
him
.
i
was
struggling
and
screaming
when
gennaro
entered
and
attacked
him
.
he
struck
gennaro
senseless
and
fled
from
the
house
which
he
was
never
more
to
enter
.
he
struck
gennaro
senseless
and
fled
from
the
house
which
he
was
never
more
to
enter
.
it
was
a
deadly
enemy
that
we
made
that
night
.
``
a
few
days
later
came
the
meeting
.
gennaro
returned
from
it
with
a
face
which
told
me
that
something
dreadful
had
occurred
.
it
was
worse
than
we
could
have
imagined
possible
.
the
funds
of
the
society
were
raised
by
blackmailing
rich
italians
and
threatening
them
with
violence
should
they
refuse
the
money
.
it
seems
that
castalotte
,
our
dear
friend
and
benefactor
,
had
been
approached
.
he
had
refused
to
yield
to
threats
,
and
he
had
handed
the
notices
to
the
police
.
it
was
resolved
now
that
such
an
example
should
be
made
of
them
as
would
prevent
any
other
victim
from
rebelling
.
at
the
meeting
it
was
arranged
that
he
and
his
house
should
be
blown
up
with
dynamite
.
there
was
a
drawing
of
lots
as
to
who
should
carry
out
the
deed
.
gennaro
saw
our
enemy
's
cruel
face
smiling
at
him
as
he
dipped
his
hand
in
the
bag
.
no
doubt
it
had
been
prearranged
in
some
fashion
,
for
it
was
the
fatal
disc
with
the
red
circle
upon
it
,
the
mandate
for
murder
,
which
lay
upon
his
palm
.
he
was
to
kill
his
best
friend
,
or
he
was
to
expose
himself
and
me
to
the
vengeance
of
his
comrades
.
it
was
part
of
their
fiendish
system
to
punish
those
whom
they
feared
or
hated
by
injuring
not
only
their
own
persons
but
those
whom
they
loved
,
and
it
was
the
knowledge
of
this
which
hung
as
a
terror
over
my
poor
gennaro
's
head
and
drove
him
nearly
crazy
with
apprehension
.
``
all
that
night
we
sat
together
,
our
arms
round
each
other
,
each
strengthening
each
for
the
troubles
that
lay
before
us
.
the
very
next
evening
had
been
fixed
for
the
attempt
.
by
midday
my
husband
and
i
were
on
our
way
to
london
,
but
not
before
he
had
given
our
benefactor
full
warning
of
this
danger
,
and
had
also
left
such
information
for
the
police
as
would
safeguard
his
life
for
the
future
.
``
the
rest
,
gentlemen
,
you
know
for
yourselves
.
we
were
sure
that
our
enemies
would
be
behind
us
like
our
own
shadows
.
gorgiano
had
his
private
reasons
for
vengeance
,
but
in
any
case
we
knew
how
ruthless
,
cunning
,
and
untiring
he
could
be
.
both
italy
and
america
are
full
of
stories
of
his
dreadful
powers
.
if
ever
they
were
exerted
it
would
be
now
.
my
darling
made
use
of
the
few
clear
days
which
our
start
had
given
us
in
arranging
for
a
refuge
for
me
in
such
a
fashion
that
no
possible
danger
could
reach
me
.
for
his
own
part
,
he
wished
to
be
free
that
he
might
communicate
both
with
the
american
and
with
the
italian
police
.
i
do
not
myself
know
where
he
lived
,
or
how
.
all
that
i
learned
was
through
the
columns
of
a
newspaper
.
but
once
as
i
looked
through
my
window
,
i
saw
two
italians
watching
the
house
,
and
i
understood
that
in
some
way
gorgiano
had
found
our
retreat
.
finally
gennaro
told
me
,
through
the
paper
,
that
he
would
signal
to
me
from
a
certain
window
,
but
when
the
signals
came
they
were
nothing
but
warnings
,
which
were
suddenly
interrupted
.
it
is
very
clear
to
me
now
that
he
knew
gorgiano
to
be
close
upon
him
,
and
that
,
thank
god
!
he
was
ready
for
him
when
he
came
.
and
now
,
gentleman
,
i
would
ask
you
whether
we
have
anything
to
fear
from
the
law
,
or
whether
any
judge
upon
earth
would
condemn
my
gennaro
for
what
he
has
done
?
''
``
well
,
mr.
gregson
,
''
said
the
american
,
looking
across
at
the
official
,
``
i
do
n't
know
what
your
british
point
of
view
may
be
,
but
i
guess
that
in
new
york
this
lady
's
husband
will
receive
a
pretty
general
vote
of
thanks
.
''
``
she
will
have
to
come
with
me
and
see
the
chief
,
''
gregson
answered
.
``
if
what
she
says
is
corroborated
,
i
do
not
think
she
or
her
husband
has
much
to
fear
.
but
what
i
ca
n't
make
head
or
tail
of
,
mr.
holmes
,
is
how
on
earth
you
got
yourself
mixed
up
in
the
matter
.

well
,
watson
,
you

one
more
specimen
of
the
tragic
and
grotesque
to
add
to

by
the
way

o'clock
